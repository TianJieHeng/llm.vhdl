# Parallel worklog

A live board, not a report. One section per track that is in flight, the files
each track owns so two agents cannot collide, and **the next step written down
BEFORE the result arrives**, branched by what the result could be.

Why the branches are pre-written: deciding what to do next while holding a
fresh result is how scope drifts and how a negative result gets talked into
being a positive one. If the branch was written before the answer was known,
the answer only has to be classified, not argued with.

## STATE OF THE BOARD, 2026-08-30 morning

### 2026-10-06 AgentCard experiment 001 (fork only): sustained synthetic storage feed

- **Scope:** new `sim/tb_agentcard_storage.vhd`, local-only runner
  `sim/run_agentcard_storage.py`, and `docs/agentcard/` report/results. Upstream
  RTL, historical entries, licenses, hardware and CI are unchanged.
- **Baseline:** synthetic C reference PASS (0 failures, 4,178 arithmetic golden
  vectors); original weight-streamer reassembly and fast/slow single/dual-clock
  cadence tests complete. Official Debian GHDL 5.0.1 installed rootlessly.
- **Result:** 12 sustained cases, lossless and bit-exact across all 2,953 groups
  per case. Shared 9/3/1-bank feed is exactly 1/3, 1/9, 1/27 group/cycle. At a
  synthetic 128-cycle request delay, 32 to 256 FIFO beats/lane raises feed from
  0.2148 to 1 group/cycle with sufficient outstanding requests; restricting the
  256-beat case to one outstanding request gives only 0.1103 group/cycle.
- **Validation:** per-lane conservation, queue/occupancy bounds, burst boundaries,
  analytical service ceilings, complete warmup/measurement/drain, five detected
  data mutations with unchecked attribution controls, and independent review.
  Measurement contains fresh reads and ends before every lane's final read.
- **Boundary:** 864-byte / 1,536-weight synthetic group feed, not executed MACs,
  LLM tokens/s, physical flash/NVMe throughput, or 120B+ model feasibility.
  See `docs/agentcard/storage-experiment-001.md` for assumptions and reproduction.
- **Next decision:** choose an explicit device concurrency/latency model and
  representative expert access/reuse trace before drawing a card memory budget.
  This entry does not launch any additional task or adopt the upstream backlog.


### 2026-10-01 FMAX + 27B FIT (main session): c_kv clears 200 on VU35P -2; the 27B fits the VU35P at 46% LUT

- **c_kv to 200 (006edac).** `attn_kv_axi`'s read limit `(lim_rec+1)*CPR` mapped
  to a combinational DSP48 MACC that was 2.4 ns of an 18-level, 5.312 ns path
  `cpos_r -> lim_beat_r`; rewritten as a shift-add (`*(CPR-1) + (lim_rec+1)`,
  CPR-1=16 a wire shift) it stays in fabric. **187.5 -> 228.2 MHz on m2**,
  bit-exact (consumer assert cross-checks), no latency/guard change, DSP 5->3.
  All 5 grades re-rated FRESH. Spec RESULT 2026-09-30. **Every shipping block now
  clears 200 on VU35P -2** (c_attn_levers 198 is the levers-on variant, held off
  on silicon). TRAP: `use_dsp` on the registered signal did NOT remove the DSP
  (Vivado keeps the multiply on an intermediate net); strength-reduce the source.
- **27B fits the VU35P (c7a7eee).** Real OOC synth+route on
  xcvu35p-fsvh2104-2-e: full card **402,006 LUT = 46.1%** (engine 133,303 @
  **222 MHz**, card 268,703), BRAM 537.5/1344 (40%), DSP 2,025/5,952 (34%),
  URAM 82/640 (13%). The VU33P was simply too small (full 27B = 99.84% CLB
  there). The composed `fk33_card` OOC "70 MHz" is a **standalone-OOC artifact**
  (9B control identical at 69.0 MHz on the same `vec_issue -> wsum` path; the
  shipped 9B build runs that compute >=120 MHz in-context, WNS +4.98 at 75 MHz,
  those nets absent from its worst paths). Nothing to pipeline. Real composed
  200 MHz timing needs the Jungle Cat block design, which does not exist. Doc:
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-30_27b-fits-vu35p-ooc-timing-artifact.md`. Harness:
  `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/ooc27_vu35/`, worktree `wt27v35`.
- **c_mover rated (BC-250), NOT shipping.** `ooc_cattnadapt_top` (anchor tier,
  NOT in `fk33_card`'s datapath): m1 132.1, m2 142.1, m2l 120.9, m3 170.9 MHz,
  all <200. A standalone adapter characterization, not a deployment blocker;
  left as-is. (vu33p grade landing.)
- **NEXT:** Jungle Cat block design scoping -- the VU35P PCIe/HBM/pinout + the
  Aurora GTY inter-card link. Unblocks real composed 27B timing AND the 2-card
  27B deployment. The GTY refclk separately needs the X1/X2 oscillator + buffer
  populated (`docs/boards/jungle-cat/2026-09-27_bringup.md` Section 16).


### 2026-09-24 IDLE POWER (main session): **tasks P1 (core clock gating) and P2 (RTL VCCINT sequencer + interlock) specced, not started**

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-idle-power.md`. Oren chose clock gating and
asked whether the idle VCCINT drop can be RTL: yes, the pot's I2C is on FPGA
pins and SYSMON is on-chip, so a closed-loop sequencer in the always-on domain
can move VCCINT in milliseconds and carry the max-voltage interlock in the
bitstream. P2 waits on the voltage sweep for build 19's hang.

### 2026-09-24 27B-1 (main session): **the 27B card build does not route on the VU33P**

Three attempts, all failed: congestion level 6, then an unrouted
re-implementation, then a reroute ending at 1,698,125 conflicts and WNS
-7.434. Placed 99.84% CLB / 91.12% LUT / 90.55% BRAM. Results
`hw/fk33/results/card_build27b_1_2026-09-24/`. No Vivado running. The
Jungle Cat estimate (`docs/2026-09-24_jungle-cat-performance-estimate.md`)
is the fabric route; on the FK33 it needs area removed first.

### 2026-09-24 CONTEXT TESTS (main session): **`fk33_ctxtest.sh` is a standing post-build step; its first short run reproduced the attention hang**

Oren: "full input context and full output context length tests after every
build, ran two times". New `hw/fk33/host/fk33_ctxtest.sh` (pair|single),
`tools/ctx_prompt.py` (deterministic N-id real-text prompt from `docs/**/*.md`),
and `FK33_PROMPT_IDS` in both chat scripts. Rule in CLAUDE.md.
MEASURED, N=256 pair on build 19: input r1 PASS (256 GOs); input r2 FAILED in
prefill at position 32, card 1 step 235, ERR_INFO 0x00EB0EB4, identical to r8.
Card 1 is wedged until a JTAG reload. Evidence in
`hw/fk33/results/card_build19_2026-09-24/silicon/hang/README.md`. The full
N=65,536 run has NOT been done on build 19 (it cannot pass while the hang is open).

### 2026-09-24 BUILD 19 ON SILICON (main session): **Task 2 holds on both cards; the pair is exact without pad norms**

- Build 19 (`8af98b8`, NORM_HBM): default route FAILED (RTSTAT-6, 21,809 nets),
  congestion rescue FAILED (264), a second route_design on the rescue's routed
  checkpoint CLOSED (WNS +0.008, WHS +0.010, 0 failing). Placer congestion is
  the A core / attention array in all three placements, build 18 included; the
  norm-fetch cells are in no hot window. 496 block-RAM tiles vs build 18's 567.
- Single card: token-0 residual bit-identical to build 18, control text
  identical. Pair (both build 19, `-nh` halves): text == single card with AND
  without pad norms; no pads is 2.2% faster. `FK33_PAD_NORMS=0` opts in; the
  default stays padded until a CAPS bit can name the bitstream.
- Traps: xdma node numbers swap on every reload (identify by seam and image
  record); `fk33_chat.sh` sent run_prompt to xdma0 while its tools used xdma1
  (fixed). `hw/fk33/results/card_build19_2026-09-24/README.md`.
- NEXT: the 27B card build (FK33_MODEL=QWEN38_27B FK33_C_MAXPOS=16384
  FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16), CAPS bit for NORM_HBM in the same build.

### 2026-09-23 TASK 2 (main session): **the norm gain is selected by the descriptor and read from HBM; in simulation only**

- RTL: `const_base` on an OP_VEC_NORM is the gain ROW (2*blk, 2*blk+1, 2*blocks);
  `seq_vec_issue` exports it (`v_cb`); `llama_top`'s per-token counter is gone;
  the load starts at accept. New generic `NORM_HBM` reads the row over `bst_*`
  (read mux shared with the B state store) from the constants image, no table
  elaborated. `gen_fk33_card.py` now builds `NORM_HBM=true`; card top and
  identity bench regenerated.
- Benches: normrev (kills the pre-fix counter, 4 of 4 landmarks), normhbm,
  bconst_normhbm, cardtop_normhbm, all bit-exact to their ROM-path landmarks.
  Two mux mutants do not bite (no program overlaps a norm with a B job).
- Tools: gen_layer_program emits the row, dprog_oracle C5 checks it, hbm_map
  derives `norm_const_offset/rows/row_bytes` and places the full image,
  pack_gdn_consts appends rows from `norm_w_<sfx>.hex`, chat scripts key their
  program cache on the generator hash.
- NEXT: re-place each image's constants block with rows (deliberate, new
  manifests), 9B NORM_HBM card build (build 19), pair without `--pad-norms`,
  then the 27B build. Details: plan Task 2; the addendum of
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-23_the-norm-gain-is-indexed-by-a-per-token-counter.md`.

### 2026-09-23 27B PREP (main session, no subagents): **the plumbing is in, the card does not fit as-is, and the norm-gain ROM is why**

- **Files:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-23-27b-two-card.md` (THE PLAN, read it first), `tools/model_cfg.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` / `gen_fk33_card.py` (`FK33_MODEL`, `FK33_C_MAXPOS`), `tools/pack_model_fk33.py` (`--model`, `--card-maxpos`, `--stripe-all-segments`), `tools/pack_gdn_consts.py` (`--shape 27b`), `hw/fk33/gen/{norm_w,qkn}_27b.hex`, `hw/fk33/results/probe27b_2026-09-23/`.
- **MEASURED, build 18 (the card both FK33s hold):** LUT 358,846 / 439,680 (81.6%), block RAM 567 / 672 (84.4%), DSP 2,087 / 2,880, URAM 32 / 320. The norm-gain image is a BRAM ROM of 11-bit codebook indices (`gwl.wix_reg 524288x11`), DERIVED 99 tiles at 65 x 4096; at 129 x 5120 it is 231 tiles (+132), and `region_mem` (+42), `swiglu_mem` (+8) and the B state store (+14) put block RAM at ~763 of 672 BEFORE B and C grow. **The gains must become a run-time store (HBM -> URAM at load, like gdn_const), which is also the fix for the per-token counter index.** Plan Task 2.
- **MEASURED, BC-250 probe arm `attn27`** (`sim/ooc_scorehdr.tcl`, N_QH=24 LAYERS=16, post-opt, cap 11G reached so wall time is not a speed): `attn_block` 116,949 LUT / 130,927 FF / 15.5 BRAM / 430 DSP; `u_arr` 76,535 LUT / 384 DSP (= 2 x 6 x 32, structural). Same-tree 9B control `attn9` and the two B arms follow; deltas go in the probe README.
- **DERIVED, HBM:** the 27B INT4 image is 14.46 GB (GDN block 216,350,720 B, attention block 210,153,472 B, head 715,313,152 B). A 33/31 split puts 7.09 GB on card 0 and 7.37 GB on card 1. The striped allocator's stack-0 segments 1..15 (4.03 GB) cannot hold 15/27 of either half, nor the 12 own stack-1 segments 12/27 of it, so `--stripe-all-segments` was added (segment 0 above the common block, every stack-1 segment); its selftest places a synthetic 7.38 GB half on 13 stack-1 segments with **43,672 KV tokens** left, so the 27B cards are built at **`C_MAXPOS = C_CTXLEN = 32768`** (`FK33_C_MAXPOS=32768`, `--card-maxpos 32768`).
- **MEASURED, BC-250 probe complete (all four arms):** same-tree post-opt OOC deltas 27B minus 9B: `attn_block` +30,122 LUT / +29,706 FF / +4.5 BRAM / +132 DSP (all in `u_arr`); `gdn_block` **+1,503 LUT / +311 FF / 0 BRAM / +2 URAM / 0 DSP** (generics verified bound; the block walks heads sequentially, so B's 27B cost is the state store x1.5 and the sweep time). DERIVED card totals: LUT ~392k (89%), ~377.6k (86%) with `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16`; block RAM 767.5/672 with the norm ROM, ~536 without; DSP 2,219. README: `hw/fk33/results/probe27b_2026-09-23/README.md`.
- **THE 27B IMAGES EXIST (12:40):** `qwen38-27b-card0-b0-32` / `card1-b33-63`, striped on 29 segments each (`--stripe-all-segments`), identical arena bases, GDN constants packed. **`C_MAXPOS` is 16384, not 32768:** B and C index their arenas by the descriptor's GLOBAL layer ordinal, so a card reserves the whole model's KV (34,816 B/token) and state (78.7 MB); the 33/31 split leaves 20,679 tokens. A host-side base offset (arena for the card's own layers, base shifted by the first ordinal) would recover 32k+ with no RTL; costed in the probe README, not taken.
- **13:05 THE 27B PROGRAMS REFUSED 50/53 A JOBS (`ERR_ALIGN: base word 8`):** at K = 5120 a lane tile is 5120 B, so only every 4th tile boundary is 4 KB aligned and a job window must start on a multiple of 192 rows (48 at K = 4096, so nothing 9B ever tripped). `gen_mv4i_desc.window_granule` now drives the lm_head window stride (17,280 at 27B) and the packer's qkv segment pad (starts 0/2112/4224); the 64 qkv tensors are re-packing and the card images re-place behind it, then the programs are regenerated (`/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/pack27b/after_repack.log`, sentinel `AFTER27_DONE`).
- **13:00 THE 27B IMAGES AND PROGRAMS AGREE:** both cards re-placed at the 192-row qkv pad (`card_kv_fits` true, 16384), GDN constants packed, card 0 program 306/306 A jobs, card 1 302/302, 0 refused. Images: `/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen38-27b-card{0-b0-32,1-b33-63}`. **What gates a 27B card build now is Task 2 (the norm-gain run-time store; block RAM 767/672 without it), then the draw at ~86% LUT with `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16`.**
- **Was in flight:** the 27B base pack (`/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen38-27b-mv4i/`, flat, all 498 matvec tensors; the per-card packs KEEP its files) and the probe's remaining three arms.
- **NEXT, branched:** (a) probe lands and B + C fit LUT below ~90% with `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16` -> Task 2 (norm store) is the only RTL change before a 27B build; (b) LUT does not close -> the 27B needs a lever on B or C or the host takes the LM head (715 MB and 15 A jobs off card 1), and that is Oren's call; either way the per-card 27B images (Task 3) can be packed as soon as the base pack ends.

### 2026-09-22 BUILD 14 ON SILICON: **loaded, caps 0x7D, throughput identical to 12b to the floor (24.578 s x3 against 24.579/24.578/24.579), same text; the register is live** -- and the weight load first REFUSED because yesterday's per-card packs had written through a symlink onto the base image's side file

- **Files:** `hw/fk33/results/card_build14_2026-09-22/silicon/` (reload log, seam and sysmon readbacks, the three control runs, diffs), README section "On silicon"; `tools/pack_model_fk33.py` symlink refusal.
- **THE CARD HOLDS BUILD 14** (`fk33_reload.sh`, no VCCINT change, 0.7160 V, 41.8 C). `fk33ctl.py seam`: `LLM2` v2, cap flags **0x0000007d**, `XEXP_OUT yes`, 26 offsets agree with the header. Weights reloaded and verified 251/251. Control (12b's exact recipe, DC-DC prompt, 20 ids, `--max-new 64`, three runs): `run_chunk` **24.578 / 24.578 / 24.578 s** against 12b's 24.579 / 24.578 / 24.579; `first argmax 32, exp 15`, 64 ids to pos 83, same opening sentence as 12b's record; stdouts differ only in the host-side `timing` figures. **Prediction held: the register costs nothing measurable.** After the run `x_exp_out` reads **8** (`logit_exp 15`, `seq_pos 83`): live and plausible, correctness is the two-card oracle's question.
- **THE LOAD REFUSED FIRST, CORRECTLY.** `nonmatvec_f32.bin: on disk 2277376 bytes, manifest says 4571136`. Cause, MEASURED: the seg27 image's `nonmatvec_f32.bin` is a SYMLINK (Aug 29) to the base `qwen35-9b-mv4i/` file; the two card directories created yesterday inherited that link; the packer saw a size mismatch and did `open(path, "wb")`, which follows the link, so card 0's pack (22:52) rewrote the BASE image's side file, shared by every image, with 16 blocks' worth. Every image on the box was silently broken for nine hours and only the loader's size check said so. Restored by re-running the base pack (250 matvec KEPT, side file rewritten, blake2b `4468d2d1...` == the seg27 manifest to the digit); the card directories were re-packed with `--drop token_embd.weight` onto real files whose hashes equal their manifests' (`049c899b...`, `fa2ff728...`), `gdn_const.bin` byte-identical, manifests identical to yesterday's except two timestamps. **The scratch programs (`card0/card1.{dtbl,rel,arena}`) are therefore still valid.**
- **A TRAP WORTH ITS OWN LINE.** A first repack WITHOUT `--drop token_embd.weight` (the flag is not recorded in any pack.log or manifest, only inferable from `dropped_tensors`) quantised a 572 MB `token_embd.weight.mv4i` into each card directory in 186 s and shifted every HBM offset; caught by comparing the manifests to their backups, not by any tool. `pack_model_fk33.py` now REFUSES to write its side file through a symlink (`refuse_symlink_target`, teeth: refuses a link, allows an absent or regular path).
- **AND THEN THE HOP'S MANTISSA PATH TURNED OUT NOT TO EXIST ON SILICON.** On the single-id reference prompt `248045`: card `argmax 846`, `x_exp_out 8`, both equal to `tok0.r9bs` (LOGITS argmax 846, `R_X-31` exp 8), so the REGISTER is right. Then `run_prompt --dump-xout` (new: `pl_read_xout` after the last GO, the hop's own read) returned **4,096 zeros**: window 3 is served from `region_mem`'s `hr_data`, which `HOST_WINDOW=false` (every card build, `gen_fk33_card.py:203`) ties to zero; the combinational window cost 2.75 M registers and was switched off 2026-09-10. The spec's "mantissas, already there" was false when written, `logit_compare_on_card.sh` had recorded it three days earlier, and `fk33_sim.c` models the window as live, so every plan test passed. Written up in `docs/debugging/2026-09-22_the-residual-window-reads-zero-on-silicon.md` with two options (A: mux the host onto the region file's registered group read port when idle, no memory; B: a 2-BRAM36 shadow of R_X, 105 BRAM free); CORRECTION appended to the spec. **Decision pending, Oren's.**
- **OPTION B BUILT (Oren's choice, 2026-09-22 08:40):** `region_mem` gains `SHADOW_REGION` (-1 = none): with `HOST_WINDOW=false`, region R_X is mirrored into a second single-write-port bank fed by the same merged write (same `wr_en/wr_addr/wr_be/wr_data`), read back with a one-cycle registered read and a lane/hit register at the same edge, so it can be a BRAM (2 RAMB36 at the card's geometry). `tools/gen_cardtop.py` passes `SHADOW_REGION => R_X`; `fk33_llama_top.vhd` and the ident bench regenerated (`--check --bench` OK). **The failing test first:** `tb_fk33_seam`'s device under test is now `fk33_llama_top` at `HOST_WINDOW => false`, the card's configuration; against HEAD's region_mem P1 FAILED with `R_X(0) reference -17280, seam 0`, the silicon defect reproduced in simulation; with the shadow, PASS. Gate rows `tb_fk33_seam` x2, `tb_region_mem`, `tb_fk33_cardtop_ident`, `tb_fk33_cardtop_adesc`, `cardtop`, `ipsync`, `fk33card` all PASS. **Teeth** (mutants on the shadow, controls PASS before and after): M2 lane off by one FAIL, M3 shadows the wrong region FAIL; SURVIVED under their own names: M1 lane enables ignored (R_X's final value is always a full-width group write, so a clobbered element never survives to the read: a floor of the design, not of the bench), M4 region-hit gate removed (the seam reads only R_X), M6 two-cycle read latency (the seam samples at least two cycles after presenting the address, so the margin is one spare cycle). Next: card build 15 = build 14 + the shadow.
- **BUILD 15 (14 + the shadow), DRAW 1 FAILED TO ROUTE.** Synthesis 26 min, composition confirmed from the log (levers 0, `HOST_WINDOW` 0, `SHADOW_REGION` 0, BRAM **569 = 567 + 2**, the shadow's predicted cost to the tile). The chain stopped the default flow after synthesis and ran the rescue recipe (`Congestion_SpreadLogic_high` / `ExtraNetDelay_high` / `AlternateCLBRouting`): placed CLB 54,640, congestion **11.75** (SOUTH 64x64), Phase 4 ended after Iteration 2 with 18,103 overlaps, **8,932 nets in resource conflict**, `u_attn/u_arr` again. The rescue recipe is now 2 for 3. Draw 2 from the same checkpoint with the placer at `AltSpreadLogic_high` (Vivado's congestion-spreading directive) launched 11:41 by `chain2.sh`; draw 1's DCPs and reports at `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/KEEP_build15_dcp/draw1/`, repo copy `hw/fk33/results/card_build15_2026-09-22/draw1/`.
- **DRAW 2 (placer `AltSpreadLogic_high`) FAILED TOO:** placed CLB 54,584 (the lowest of any draw), congestion 11.92 (WEST 64x64), Phase 4 ended after Iteration 2 with 33,201 overlaps, **12,438 nets in resource conflict**, this time named in `eng/dut/core` (A) as well as `u_attn/u_arr`. Five draws on the 14/15 netlists, one routed. Draw 3 (the DEFAULT recipe, `Performance_RefinePlacement`) launched 14:08 by `chain3.sh`. **Oren's decision (14:05): if draw 3 fails, halve `C_KV_BLOCK` to 16**, an area lever inside the congested array, at a C-slope cost to be measured on the card.
- **KV_BLOCK 16 PREPARED AND ORACLE-CHECKED (15:45, while draw 3 routes).** Worktree `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/wt16` = build 15's tree + `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16 python3 hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` (one line, `C_KV_BLOCK => 16`, stamped; `--check` OK). Host KV layout UNCHANGED by construction: `attn_kv_axi`'s `CH_B` is a constant 16 bytes and `CHK_HDR_FITS = 16 - 16*8/8 = 0`, so `REC_B` stays 272 and the seg27 manifest and `pl_backend`'s K/V programming stand. Values MEASURED against the C oracles at KV_BLOCK 16 with vectors generated at 16: `tb_attn_kv_quant` PASS bit-exact (64 x 256, control at 32 PASS); `tb_attn_kv_axi` records, headers, mantissas and memory image bit-exact on dw128 and dw256, and its ONE failing check is the coverage assert `ARVALID was never pending during a flush` on dw256, i.e. the drain-then-flush stability axis is VACUOUS on the FK33 width at this geometry. A scratch sweep of the flush placement delay (0 to 12 ticks) leaves dw256 at 0 at every delay while dw128 counts 17 down to 5, so it is the prefetch geometry (RBUF 4 against a 16-header consumer), not the stimulus instant; the RTL's AR path is not parameterised by NBLK. Recorded as a HARNESS COVERAGE FLOOR, open, in `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build16/COMPOSITION.md`; a record-index sweep is running. Build 16 scripts (`build16/chain.sh`: default flow, rescue re-implementation only on failure; guard, watch) are written and NOT launched: they wait on draw 3's verdict.
- **DRAW 3 (default recipe) ROUTED, AND MISSES TIMING BY 0.254 ns (18:00).** `report_route_status` 681,010/681,010 fully routed, 0 routing errors, Phase 8 clean; iterations ended at 530 / 0 / 0 / 0 overlaps against draws 1 and 2's 18,103 and 33,201. Routed WNS **-0.254** (TNS -57.5, 597 failing endpoints, all on the 75 MHz clock), WHS +0.009; the router's own Phase 12 physical synthesis had taken it from -0.610. A bitstream was written (`REIMPL_RUNDONE ... write_bitstream Complete!`) but it is a timing-failing image and is not loaded. **Every one of the ten worst paths is `u_kv` `r_beat_reg -> mbank_reg/CE`, 33 logic levels with 14 CARRY8: `rtl/attn_kv_axi.vhd` divides the 32-bit beat counter by CPR = 17 (and `rr mod RBUF`) combinationally on every beat.** Root-caused in `docs/debugging/2026-09-22_the-kv-fetcher-divides-by-17-on-every-beat.md`; the RTL now keeps `(rr, mm, slot)` as counters advanced per beat (bit-exact on the C-oracle bench at KV_BLOCK 32 and 16, both widths, identical AR counts; two mutants killed). In flight: draw 3b = `phys_opt_design AggressiveExplore` on draw 3's routed DCP (the cheap control of whether the remaining 0.254 is movable without a re-synthesis, `card15-reimpl4`); the other gate rows that instantiate the fetcher; and an OOC synthesis of the fetcher at the card generics on the BC-250, counters against divider, for the path's structural depth.
- **DRAW 3b -0.028 (18:53); BUILD 17 LAUNCHED 19:38 (Oren's choice: 15 + the counters, KV_BLOCK 32).** Post-route `phys_opt AggressiveExplore` on draw 3's DCP recovered 0.226 of the 0.254 ns; the 103 endpoints left are all the same `ph_ch_reg -> mbank CE` divider path (33-34 levels), so phys_opt is not the answer and no bitstream was written. Build 17 = worktree `wt17` at f14121d + levers-off patch, default flow with the rescue re-implementation chained on a route failure, `card17-build`, root `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build17/root`, composition and predictions in `build17/COMPOSITION.md` (LUT down ~4k in u_kv ESTIMATE, worst path no longer in u_kv, closure at 75 MHz NOT predicted, routing a lottery). Fallbacks in order: rescue recipe from build 17's synth DCP; build 16 (KV_BLOCK 16 + counters, worktree `wt16` and `build16/launch.sh` ready); a second phys_opt pass on draw 3b's checkpoint (untested).
- **BUILD 17 CLOSED (23:35: routed WNS +0.373 on the 75 MHz clock, 0 failing, 0 routing errors, first default draw) AND COMPUTES WRONG VALUES ON SILICON (23:43).** Control `first argmax 0, exp 44`, 64 x `!`, run_chunk 24.521 s x3 (build 14: argmax 32, exp 15, 24.578 s); token 0 argmax 0 / exp 43 / XEXP_OUT 14 / window zero (reference 846 / exp 8). Host-side control: build 14 reloaded on the same host and image reproduces its numbers, so the image is the defect. Two RTL changes over build 14: the R_X shadow (build 15) and the KV counters (f14121d); GHDL passes every row on both. Attribution running: draw 3b's DCP (shadow, no counters, -0.028) written to a DIAGNOSTIC bitstream (`card15-reimpl5`), and `tb_llama_top_real` on the counters RTL. **The card holds build 14.** Results in `hw/fk33/results/card_build17_2026-09-22/README.md`.
- **ATTRIBUTED 23:48: THE R_X SHADOW (f0fcb37), NOT THE COUNTERS.** Draw 3b's checkpoint (shadow, no counters, -0.028) as a diagnostic image reproduces build 17's numbers to the digit; build 14 reloaded reproduces its own. One RTL commit lies between build 14's tree and build 15's. Symptom shape = an all-zero residual (zero window under exponent 14, argmax 0, a 0.23% shorter token): region 0 is not taking its writes on silicon. RTL right in GHDL (`tb_fk33_seam` P1 fails without the shadow, passes with it); the netlist is the question; census of region 0 in builds 17 and 14 running (`build17/census/`). Doc: `docs/debugging/2026-09-22_the-r-x-shadow-zeroes-the-residual-on-silicon.md`. **The card holds build 14.**
- **MECHANISM (23:57, netlist census of both routed DCPs): region 0's four `bank_reg` BRAMs have ALL EIGHT `WEBWE` pins tied to `<const0>` in build 17; the write decode (155 LUTs on `bank_reg` in build 14) exists only on the shadow BRAMs.** The engine reads a never-written R_X. The tool merged the write logic of two RAMs fed by one write port and kept it on the shadow. Stage (synth vs opt/power_opt) from the synth-DCP census, running. Fix direction: no duplicate storage; serve the window from the engine's own element read port, time-multiplexed at idle with a busy guard (the option A of the residual-window doc, now the safe one), or a third read port on `bank` and let the tool replicate. Decision to Oren.
- **FIXED (00:15): the shadow is withdrawn, the card's window rides the element read port, and the build flow refuses a dead region-0 write port.** Stage MEASURED on the synthesis checkpoint: all four region-0 BRAMs already had `WEBWE/WEA` on `<const0>` out of `synth_design`. `rtl/region_mem.vhd` reverted to f0fcb37^ (+ a header note); `llama_top`'s `elmux` hands the element read port to `(hr_reg, hr_addr)` on idle cycles with `hr_win_q` marking the host's word; `gen_cardtop.py` emits the window from `el_rdata` (no second array, no new port, no new pin). Teeth: `tb_fk33_seam` in the card configuration PASS, FAIL with the window cut (`M_WINCUT`). All rows green: region_mem, cardtop_ident/adesc, cardtop check, llama_top_seq/real/kvport/normw, csweep_rate, fk33_seam(+wdog), runguard, ipsync, fk33card, gdnstale. `gen_pcieep.py` now opens `synth_1` after synthesis and errors `FK33_REGION0_WE FAIL` if any region-0 BRAM has all write enables on constant nets: validated FAIL on build 17's synth DCP and OK on build 14's routed netlist (a first draft crashed Vivado by closing the design inside the catch; fixed). CLAUDE.md carries the trap. Build 18 = this HEAD + levers off (worktree `wt18`), **launched 2026-09-23 00:25** as `card18-build` and **KILLED BY THE SWAP GUARD at 00:35** (swap 30G, avail 740 MB, ten minutes into synthesis; build 17 had peaked at 26G from a 4G baseline, this launch started from 7-8G of stale swap with no Ollama model loaded and no llama-server). **Relaunched 00:38 with `FK33_SYNTH_THREADS=1`** (one recorded parameter changed against build 17's launch, one ~2.4 GB synthesis worker fewer, ~30% slower synthesis; guard unchanged at 30G). `build18/COMPOSITION.md` pre-registers `FK33_REGION0_WE OK`, BRAM 567, and the silicon numbers.
- **BUILD 18 CLOSED AND IS CORRECT ON SILICON (04:36).** Routed core-clock WNS +0.225, 0 failing, 0 routing errors, first default draw; `FK33_REGION0_WE OK` (8 live write pins on each region-0 BRAM, against build 17's 0). On the card: control `argmax 32 / exp 15`, **24.578 s x3 == build 14**, token 0 `argmax 846 / XEXP_OUT 8`, and **window 3 reads real mantissas for the first time** (4,093 non-zero, exp 8, corr 0.9965 / rel RMS 0.084 against the llama.cpp anchor, which is the right instrument for a cross-format comparison; bit-identity with the card's own R_X is Task 11's pair-vs-single question). **The card holds build 18.** Results: `hw/fk33/results/card_build18_2026-09-23/`.
- **07:06 single-card oracle recorded on build 18** (`hw/fk33/results/twocard_9b_2026-09-23/single_card_build18/`): three prompts, 128 tokens, three repeats each; ids, text and the final R_X window byte-identical across repeats; 3.35 tok/s at p~80-147, prefill 0.308 s/pos, run_chunk repeatable to 1 ms in 43.7 s. `run_prompt --ids-out` (a0ccaa0) writes the reference the pair is judged on; `run_pair.sh` is staged. Trap: `fk33_chat.sh`'s `set -- $GB` ate pass-through args; fixed.
- **08:45 second card install decided:** MCIO host adapter in the free CHIPSET x4 slot, second FK33 on the cable; first FK33 and the 3090 Ti stay put, no BIOS change. Both cards at Gen3 x4 behind the DMI x8 uplink, which is irrelevant to the 8 KiB hop. After boot: `lspci -d 10ee:` for both addresses, pin the second one in `fk33-pci` (root-owned literal by design) and its JTAG serial for `fk33_reload.sh`, reload build 18 on both, load the two per-card images, `run_pair.sh 1`.
- **10:05 THE PAIR EQUALS THE SINGLE CARD, AND PREFILL IS 1.84x.** Both cards on the bus (card 2 on the MCIO riser from the free chipset slot, no BIOS change; `fk33-pci` pins two addresses; `fk33_reload.sh` maps serial to address and checks the other card stays up), both reloaded with build 18 and the per-card images. First pair run diverged at positions 7/28/0; ROOT-CAUSED in one morning: `NORM_W_IMAGE` is indexed by a per-token norm-op COUNTER, so card 1 normalised with block 0's gains (`docs/debugging/2026-09-23_the-norm-gain-is-indexed-by-a-per-token-counter.md`, bit-exact bisect down to the first step). Workaround `gen_layer_program --pad-norms 2*lo` in `fk33_chat2.sh`: MATCH on all three prompts (128/128/70 ids), 1,240-id prompt 215.9 s vs 398.1 s single, decode 0.311 vs 0.299 s/token. Results `hw/fk33/results/twocard_9b_2026-09-23/`. Task 11 CLOSED; the two-card plan is complete.
- **NEXT / BACKLOG.** (1) RTL fix for the norm gain index (index `NW_TBL` by the VEC_NORM step's block, 2 per block + tail; a card build ~4.5 h, then drop the padding; needs a bench row that runs a program starting at block > 0 against the full program, which no bench does today, which is why this reached silicon). (2) The 27B: images at the split (Task 12's shape is in), the `MODEL := QWEN38_27B` card build and its fit. (3) The pair's first-prompt 16 s one-off. Old NEXT follows.
- **(superseded) NEXT.** Task 11 pair steps (second card on the MCIO cable, `/dev/xdma1`): `bash /mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build18/oracle/run_pair.sh 1` after both cards are loaded; both cards loaded with build 18, single-card oracle vs the pair on the same prompt, hop timing, 1,240-id prefill vs 393.9 s; fix or replace the window path, build 18 (with the counters, which stand); then load, caps 0x7D, control 24.578 s, `--dump-xout` on token 248045 against `R_X-31`, load, `--dump-xout` on the reference token against `R_X-31`; then Task 11 needs the second card in the bifurcated slot (`/dev/xdma1`); until it enumerates, the pair steps (both cards loaded, single-card oracle vs pair, hop timing, 1,240-id prefill vs 393.9 s) cannot run. Everything on the software side is in place: `fk33_chat2.sh`, the two card images, their programs, build 14 on card 0.

### 2026-09-22 BUILD 14: **12b's design plus only the two-card register FAILED TO ROUTE by 11 nets at congestion 11.73, INSIDE the trigger's legal band, and then CLOSED on re-implementation from the same checkpoint: 0 routing errors, WNS +0.056 at 75 MHz, bitstream written** -- the CONGABORT separation is withdrawn from below; the `card_swg` rescue recipe is now 2 for 2 on failed draws

- **Files:** `hw/fk33/results/card_build14_2026-09-22/` (README, route status, reports, `COMPOSITION.md`, `PREDICTION_congestion.md`, `phase8_nets.txt`, `reimpl.tcl`); DCPs at `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/KEEP_build14_dcp/`; CORRECTION appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-21_congestion-early-abort-trigger-selection.md`.
- **THE VERDICT:** `report_route_status` 680,703 routable, 680,692 fully routed, **11 with resource conflicts**; no bitstream. 6h10m wall, `route_design` 4h49m (Iteration 1 alone ~2 h, overlaps down to 43 before Iteration 2 gave up). Composition verified from the log: all four levers bound to 0, `CB_STYLE=distributed`, 75 MHz, `FK33_SEAMWIRE 41` (was 40), `FK33_UNCONNECTED 0`.
- **THE PREDICTION MISSED, WHICH IS THE RESULT.** Pre-registered at 00:57: 11.73 max Global `% Tiles`, legal band, predicted a legal route. A run at 11.73 failed while 12b at 11.95 routed. The 0.83-point separation over twelve runs is gone; the trigger's own open item is answered from the wrong side. Above ~12.5 still no run has ever routed, so the ABORT use survives; below it means nothing.
- **WHERE:** 7 of the 11 nets in `gcr.u_attn/u_arr` (accumulators), the same array build 13's overlap nodes named with all four levers on. The array is where this design is tight at any lever state; 12b routed it at the margin. Placed CLB 54,884 (76 free) for FEWER LUTs than 12b (361,887 vs 367,495): per-draw packing scatter is the plausible mechanism for one draw routing and the next not, and it is a hypothesis.
- **RE-IMPLEMENTATION VERDICT (07:46): CLOSED.** `report_route_status` 681,069 routable, 681,069 fully routed, **0 routing errors**; routed **WNS +0.056, 0 failing of 1,528,825, WHS +0.009, 0 hold failing**, clock 13.333 ns / 75 MHz; bitstream 25,771,342 bytes, sha256 `d9f0cb13...`, in `hw/fk33/results/card_build14_2026-09-22/bd_wrapper.bit`. 1h52m wall, `route_design` 1h15m against the first draw's 4h49m. Same netlist (`opt_design` checksums identical): placed CLB 54,607 against 54,884, congestion 10.37 against 11.73, zero overlaps reached in Iteration 3. **One netlist, two recipes, one routed: the first one-variable implementation control on the card build.** Branch taken: the bitstream goes on the card for Task 11 after the caps 0x7D check.
- **WAS RUNNING, `card14-reimpl`:** `impl_1` again from build 14's own `synth_1` checkpoint with `Congestion_SpreadLogic_high` / place `ExtraNetDelay_high` / route `AlternateCLBRouting` / phys_opt `AggressiveExplore`, the recipe that took `card_swg` from 13.45 to 9.33 and a routed +0.050 on the same checkpoint. One-variable implementation control, no synthesis. Sentinels `^REIMPL_*`, log `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build14/reimpl.log`.
- **BRANCHES, written before the verdict.** Routes and closes at 75 MHz: that bitstream is build 14's, goes on the card for Task 11 (caps 0x7D check first), and the recipe becomes the default question for the next build. Routes but misses timing: a bound on this recipe, not on the design; try one more draw of the default recipe from the same checkpoint before changing RTL. Fails to route: two recipes on one netlist both fail, so the register build needs area back (the 433-tile scatter says a placement seed is the cheapest lever; a real one is anything in `u_attn/u_arr`).

### 2026-09-21 BUILD 13: **FAILED TO ROUTE, 11,561 nets in resource conflict, no bitstream; the congestion trigger's second live verdict was correct** -- four levers at once, so nothing is attributable to any one of them

- **Files:** `hw/fk33/results/card_build13_2026-09-21/` (README, route status, placed utilization flat and hierarchical, routed timing summary, DRC, logs, `COMPOSITION.md`, `PREDICTION_congestion.md`, `phase8_nets.txt`). DCPs at `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/KEEP_build13_dcp/` with `SHA256SUMS`.
- **THE VERDICT, FROM `report_route_status`:** 682,717 routable, 671,156 fully routed, **11,561 with resource conflicts**; `DRC RTSTAT-6`, `Bitgen not run`. 4h17m wall, `route_design` 2h54m. Composition: 12b's tree (`9de6ee4`, no patch) with `NWIDE=1 FAST_POP=1 SWEEP_PIPE=1 SCORE_EARLY=1` all bound in the log, `CB_STYLE=distributed` x4, 75 MHz. The `XEXP_OUT` register is NOT in it (the tree predates dbf3ea5).
- **THE PREDICTION HIT.** `PREDICTION_congestion.md` (20:50, mid-Phase 4): max Global `% Tiles` **13.09** against the 12.5 threshold, predicted NOT a legal route. Two live uses of the trigger, one each way (12b at 11.95 routed, 13 at 13.09 did not), both correct; the 0.83-point gap is still the whole margin and the false-positive rate is still unbounded.
- **WHERE, NOT WHY.** All 8 named nets at Phase 8's top ten overlap nodes are in `gcr.u_attn/u_arr`; RTSTAT-6 alternates `u_attn/u_arr/ARG__1[*]` with `eng/dut/core/ARG__1[*]`. Location only. Build 10 (NWIDE alone) put 98.08% of its failing endpoints in C too, and both are multi-variable against 12b. Placed: 54,802 CLB tiles (99.71%, 158 free) for **fewer** LUTs (-4,269) and FFs (-1,650) than 12b, i.e. the packer spread this netlist out, which is consistent with the congestion and is not a cause.
- **THE ROUTED WNS -1.789 IS NOT A TIMING RESULT** (a design 11,561 nets short of routed), recorded only because its worst paths are the same `u_kv` `mbank_reg` CE fan-out the 12b characterisation named.
- **NEXT, AS BRANCHED BEFORE THE VERDICT:** build 14 = 12b's lever state (`build12_levers_off.patch`) plus the two-card `XEXP_OUT` register, so Task 11 of the two-card plan does not wait on the lever question. The lever question: re-implement `KEEP_build13_dcp/bd_wrapper_synth.dcp` under other directives (exact control, ~20 min of synthesis saved), then one-variable builds if a directive routes it.

### 2026-09-21 TRACK TWOCARD: **the two-card layer-split pipeline is built and verified in simulation up to the silicon step** -- tasks 1-10, 12 and the follow-on 13 (prefill overlap) of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-21-two-card-pipeline.md` landed; Task 11 (card build 14 with the `XEXP_OUT` register, two cards loaded, silicon oracle) is HUMAN/main-session and waits on build 13's verdict

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/seq_region_lock.vhd`, `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (+ regenerated `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, `sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd`), `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd`, `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` (+ regenerated `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd`, `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`), `server/fk33_seam.h`, `server/fk33_sim.c`, `server/pl_backend.[ch]`, new `server/pl_pipeline.[ch]`, `server/tests/seam_selftest.c`, `server/tests/run_prompt.c`, `tools/gen_layer_program.py`, `tools/pack_model_fk33.py`, `tools/hbm_map.py`, `hw/fk33/host/fk33ctl.py`, new `hw/fk33/host/fk33_chat2.sh`, benches `sim/tb_seq_vec_seam.vhd`, `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`, `sim/tb_fk33_seam.vhd`, `sim/mutate_fk33_seam.sh` (row M15), `sim/regress.sh` (row `sim:splitplan`). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-two-card-pipeline-design.md`, commits 863d173 .. bff8efa.
- **THE DESIGN.** Layer split over PCIe only: card 0 runs blocks 0..k-1 headless, card 1 runs k..N-1 plus the LM head. The residual R_X leaves card 0 through seam window 3 (mantissas, already there) plus a NEW register `XEXP_OUT` at 0xA4 (its block exponent; capability bit 6), and enters card 1 through window 2 plus `X_EXP`. Global `blk` numbering is kept on both cards so KV and GDN addressing does not move. The hop is host software (`pl_pipeline.c`): read R_X from card 0, push it and GO card 1. **Prefill OVERLAPS (f0b9d81, Task 13):** card 0 runs position k+1 while card 1 runs k through `pl_go_async`/`pl_wait`, with a `-7` guard on every verb that would touch a card mid-token; the serial loop stays behind `plp_set_serial` / `run_prompt --serial-prefill` as the baseline. Decode cannot overlap (position p+1's id is card 1's argmax at p). MEASURED in simulation: overlapped == serial == single card token for token; 5 of 7 mutants killed, the two survivors (a window write during a token, card 0's argmax substituted) are invisible to the identity-engine simulator by construction and are Task 11's to see.
- **THE OBSERVATION PATH, WITH TEETH.** `seq_region_lock` now pulses `cap_valid/cap_region/cap_exp` at every capture; `llama_top` latches the R_X one into `x_exp_out`; the seam latches it at the same clean `tok_done` edge as the logit exponent. MEASURED: `tb_seq_vec_seam` sees NRES+1 captures (the +1 is `seq_opdec`'s T_PUB publishing the host exponent, which is correct and was a surprise); `jb_dst+1` mutant killed, control rerun against HEAD's bench after the first control was confounded by a still-active `severity error` report; `tb_llama_top` compares `x_exp_out` per token against the last R_X capture; `tb_fk33_seam` P8 checks 0xA4 against the reference top, caps word 125, mutant M15 bites. The pin reaches the block design through `SEAM_FROM_CARD` and `fk33_card.vhd` (`x_exp_out : out signed(15 downto 0)`); the build script was regenerated with its stamp (`FK33_CARD=1 FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75`).
- **THE PROGRAMS AND IMAGES.** `gen_layer_program.py --blocks-range LO:HI --no-lmhead` emits one card's program (END_TOKEN at `blk=hi+1` on the headless card, shorter arena accepted); `--selfcheck-split` is gate row `sim:splitplan` and proves, for 9b and now 27b, that every cut sums to the whole token with the release differing on one step of the last card-0 block only. `pack_model_fk33.py --blocks LO:HI` drops the other card's blocks (head only on the last card) and models the headless card's host blocks from GGUF metadata, which needed a fallback at two sites that used to require `output.weight`. Images built: `/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen35-9b-card0-b0-15/` and `qwen35-9b-card1-b16-31/`, `gdn_const.bin` identical to seg27's; programs at `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/twocard/card{0,1}.{dtbl,rel,arena}` (148 and 163 A jobs).
- **THE HOST, VERIFIED AGAINST THE SINGLE CARD AS ORACLE.** MEASURED (fk33_sim v2, both cards simulated, prompt of 5 ids, 12 generated): `seam_selftest` T15 (hop) and T16 (pipeline == single) PASS, 180 checks; `run_prompt --dtbl2/--rel2/--manifest2/--dev2` gives first argmax 238086 == single card, 8 hops, and the 12 streamed tokens are byte-identical (`cmp`, 93 bytes each). **RESOLUTION FLOOR, NOT FIXED:** the simulator folds mantissas and position only, so a mutant adding 1 to the exponent on the hop SURVIVES T16. Only silicon (Task 11) sees the exponent path end to end.
- **THE 27B SHAPE IS IN THE GENERATOR** (`--shape 27b`, transcribed from `rtl/model_cfg_pkg.vhd` and checked field for field): 993 steps per token (48 GDN x 16, 16 attn x 13, +2, +15 LM-head windows). The 27B images, the `MODEL := QWEN38_27B` build and its fit are the NEXT plan.
- **NEXT, BRANCHED.** Build 13 LEGAL -> build 14 from a worktree at bff8efa or later with the same four levers plus the register; build 13 FAILS to route -> build 14 is 12b's lever state plus the register (the register is 17 flops and a mux entry, not a timing lever), so the two-card rehearsal does not wait on the lever question. Either way Task 11 is main-session only: `fk33_reload.sh` per card, `fk33ctl.py seam` must show caps bit 6 on both, then three prompts x 128 tokens single card (full seg27 image) as the oracle against the pair, then the 1,240-id prompt against 393.9 s. **Subagents get no hardware access.**
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) The hop cost on silicon: 2 x 4 KiB mantissa window plus one register read plus one GO, per token, over Gen3 x4 through the MMIO path; no number yet. (2) Whether the second card's slot (bifurcated x8/x8 + MCIO) enumerates as `/dev/xdma1`; `fk33_chat2.sh` assumes it. (3) CLOSED while writing this: `tok0.r9bs` is at its canonical path `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/refs/tok0.r9bs` (5,976,368 bytes, `ls -la` 2026-09-21 23:05), so nothing needs regenerating before Task 11.

### 2026-09-21 TRACK CBREVERT: **the per-row codebook is REVERTED and the nine mutation rows are back on their pre-change anchors, verdict-preserving over 20 rows x 9 columns -- AND BUILD 11b WAS SYNTHESISED AT `CB_STYLE=regs`, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR EVERY NUMBER THREE DOCUMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO `0b34200`**

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` (REVERTED to `0b34200^`, md5 `c3325ea1f418dcbcaa85f33e47e8c901` -> `b616c7822f93154b08200f9418489012`), `sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh` (`fec08d650058155141c9b9555c17ee66` -> the committed value), `docs/debugging/2026-09-21_the-revert-and-the-lever-that-was-never-set.md` (new), this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends). `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh` (`cca6fd82...`) and `sim/ooc_cbooc.tcl` (`07b49ea8...`) NOT opened for writing -- CBRUN's. `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc*`, `sim/mutate_desc_fastpop.sh` NOT opened. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving build 9 at 2.46 tok/s throughout. **NO VIVADO STARTED**: the workstation lane held a CBOOC draw (`/proc/1473886/exe` = `.../unwrapped/lnx64.o/vivado`, `/proc/1473886/cwd` = `.../cbooc_descaxi_main/run_20260921_065042_1471846/out_old`, 5.86 GB VmRSS) and the BC-250 lane held CBRUN. Largest process of this track: **`ghdl-mcode` at ~0.18 GB**, `MemAvailable` never below 19 GiB. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/cbrevert`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE REVERT IS EXACT, AND "EXACT" IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT AN ASSERTION.** `0b34200` is the ONLY commit that has ever touched `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` since `0b34200^`, so the revert is a checkout; and `git show 0b34200 -- rtl/matvec_core.vhd | git apply --check -` is **CLEAN**, which proves the restored file is that commit's pre-image byte for byte rather than merely md5-equal to a remembered value. 4 hunks reversed, 4 hunks in the commit. **Nothing committed since was discarded** -- CBANCHOR (`9435942`) touched only `sim/`, and its work is preserved in detail below.
- **AND THE REASON EVERYONE HAD FOR REVERTING IS CONFOUNDED, BY A VARIABLE BOTH BUILDS PRINT ON A LINE OF THEIR OWN.** MEASURED, three builds, two independent instruments: the line-anchored `^FK33_CB_STYLE` sentinel and Vivado's own `Parameter CB_STYLE bound to` binding. **Build 9 `distributed` (4x), build 10 `distributed` (4x, `regs` 0x), BUILD 11b `regs` (4x) with NO sentinel at all.** `build11b/build.stdout:6788` is `Parameter CB_STYLE bound to: regs` and `:6789` is `done synthesizing module 'matvec_core'`, adjacent. At `regs` the RTL computes `CB_LANES_PER_COPY = 32` and `CB_COPIES = 48`, so `CB_RANKS = min(48,48) = 48 = CB_COPIES` and **`cb_rank_of(c) = c` is THE IDENTITY: `0b34200` is a no-op in build 11b.** `sim/ooc_cbooc.tcl` already refuses to draw at `regs` for precisely this reason.
- **`regs` PREDICTS EVERY "EXACT" FINGERPRINT, ALL SEVEN.** `MUXF8 +12,288` = 1,536 lanes x 8 bits of 16:1 read mux; `MUXF7 +24,600` against 1,536 x 16; `RAMD32 -21,528` = 1,536 `RAM32M16` x 14; `RAMS32 -3,080` against 1,536 x 2; `cbw_v` control sets **1,536 -> 48** = `CB_COPIES` 1,536 -> 48; `cb` storage LUTRAM -> **48 x 128 = 6,144 FF** = 48 copies x 16 x 8; and `[Synth 8-5859]` declining, because no `ram_style = distributed` is requested at all. The read at `matvec_core.vhd:1002` is `cb((rr*BLK + j) / CB_LANES_PER_COPY)(idx)` with `idx` dynamic, so `166a32d`'s routing evidence -- 38 of 40 named contending nets being `core/cb[][][]` into `core/tr_reg[...]_i_NN` -- **is that mux tree, and `regs` builds it whether or not `0b34200` is applied.**
- **WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT OVERTURN.** It does NOT show `0b34200` is harmless: it shows **no measurement exists that attributes anything to it**, because no build has ever drawn it at `distributed`. It does NOT make build 11b's failure mysterious -- the mux tree is real and Vivado named it. **And it does NOT make the revert wrong**, because `docs/WORKLOG.md:68`'s own rule -- *"DO NOT PUT RTL ON A CARD BUILD THAT NO SYNTHESISER HAS EVER DRAWN"* -- applies to `0b34200` exactly: nothing has drawn it at the geometry where it is not the identity. **The revert is correct for that reason, independent of CBRAM's mechanism.**
- **THE ONE LINE THAT MUST BE IN BUILD 12'S COMMAND, AND IT WAS NOT IN BUILD 11b'S.** `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh` does not set `FK33_CB_STYLE`; `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py:601` defaults it to `regs`; and `systemctl --user show fastpop-build.service -p Environment` for build 11b reads `BUILD_ROOT=... FK33_CARD=1` and nothing else. **Build 12 must be launched with `FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed` explicitly, or it reproduces build 11b's 1,536 mux trees with the revert in place.** This is the trap in its purest form: copying the recorded invocation is the right instinct and would have rebuilt the defect.
- **CBANCHOR'S NINE ROWS: RESTORED, AND THE RESTORATION IS VERDICT-PRESERVING AS A MEASUREMENT.** `K2a K2b K2c K3a K3b K3c K3d K7a K7b` are back on their pre-change anchors, `K2b` and `K3c` from **two anchors each back to ONE** -- the loop split CBANCHOR identified as unrepairable by substitution, undone in the direction it came. **Control: the PRE-CBANCHOR harness (`9cdf13b`) against the REVERTED tree, against the new harness on the same tree, diffed column for column. 20 rows x 9 columns, `diff` empty, at `CBSTYLE=distributed` AND at `regs`.** `16 KILLED + 0 ABORTED + 4 SURVIVED = 20 of 20`; survivors `K1b K3d K8a K8b`; `P_CB_MODEL earned: K2b K2c`. Every edit asserted `count == 1` before it was applied.
- **WHAT WAS KEPT FROM CBANCHOR BECAUSE IT IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE RTL FORM**: the `@P_CB@` scopes, the `DEAD_TAGS` ledger and its nonzero exit, the per-process neuter with its assert census, and the corrected `K2b`/`K2c` legends (CBANCHOR measured both KILLED on the OLD tree too, so the correction is a property of `P_CB_MODEL` existing and survives the revert -- confirmed by the run). Every class note carries a dated CORRECTION paragraph rather than a deletion. **MEASURED: every restored anchor is unique in the whole file AND inside `P_CB`, so the scopes change no verdict today and were kept as insurance rather than because they were load-bearing. But the bare `for c in 0 to CB_COPIES-1 loop` matches TWICE (`P_CB` and `P_CB_MODEL`), so the hazard is one careless anchor away.**
- **K10a, K10b AND MODE P ARE RETIRED, NOT RE-ANCHORED, AND THAT IS THE DISPOSITION NO ANCHOR REPAIR SUBSTITUTES FOR.** MEASURED: `CB_RANKS`, `cb_rank_of`, `cb_ranks_f`, `cb_rank_chk_f` and `CHK_CB_RANKS` all have grep count **0** after the revert. They mutate a declaration that no longer exists. Both rows are kept **commented out with their anchors verbatim** -- CBANCHOR measured them green, so they are a working pair waiting for their RTL. **The mode-P branch is KEPT rather than deleted, deliberately**: with it, `MODES="A P"` exits 1 and names the missing pin (teeth-tested); without it, CBANCHOR's own recorded trap fires -- *"an unknown mode is not an error, it is mode A"* -- and P prints a plausible third column. **WHAT IS LOST, stated rather than absorbed: the only instrument that could see the copy-to-rank map at all. `K3d` remains, models the collapse at the write site, and SURVIVES; nothing in this harness now scores a fanout lever.**
- **TEETH ON THE MACHINERY THAT WAS KEPT, THREE WAYS, RE-SHOWN ON THE REVERTED TREE RATHER THAN INHERITED.** **T1 ledger**: K7b's anchor broken -> rc 1, `ROWS THAT DID NOT RUN:1`, and `15 of 20` so the tallies deliberately do not add up. **T2 scope, three ways on a genuinely ambiguous anchor**: unscoped -> `ANCHOR 0 MATCHED 2 TIMES`; scoped -> applies; `@P_NOSUCH@` -> `NAMES UNKNOWN SCOPE`. **T3 mode P** -> rc 1, `NEUTER: CHK_CB_RANKS declaration matched 0 times`.
- **GATES, ELEVEN ROWS, md5 WINDOW AT BOTH ENDS** (`06:47:11` / `06:58:58`, `matvec_core.vhd` `b616c782`, `regress.sh` `91f5619a`, all three benches identical): `--only tb_matvec_cb` **PASS 2**, `tb_matvec_core` **PASS 2**, `tb_matvec_int4` **PASS 2**, `tb_matvec_axi` **PASS 1**, `runguard` **PASS 1**, `cardtop` **PASS 3**, `graygate` **PASS 1**, `seamgate` **PASS 6**. `FAIL 0 NOVERDICT 0 TIMEOUT 0 BUILD-ERROR 0 NOCHECK 0 SKIPPED 0` on every one, and every `PASS n` non-zero. **The first four reproduce `5dc3ee5`'s and CBANCHOR's figures (2/2/2/1) exactly**, which is the control that the revert changed no value.
- **THE OTHER THREE LEVERS ARE AT HEAD, WITH THE LINE NUMBERS CHECKED AND ONE OF THEM CORRECTED.** `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py` **line 114** (not 113 as the brief said) reads `FAST_POP_DEFAULT = True`. `rtl/llama_top.vhd:6997` and `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd:7621` both carry `SWEEP_PIPE => true, SCORE_EARLY => true` -- `:7621` is ATTNWIRE's figure to the line. **AND THE FLAG THAT GOES WITH IT: `166a32d` MEASURED zero occurrences of either in `wt11`, so build 12 from HEAD carries RTL that no `FK33_CARD=1` synthesis has ever drawn -- the exact thing `:68` above says not to do.** Whether an OOC draw of `attn_block` at `SWEEP_PIPE=true SCORE_EARLY=true` exists was NOT established here. `FAST_POP=true` HAS been in a card build (11b) and is not implicated by anything.
- **MY OWN SELF-MATCH FAILURE, CAUGHT BY MY OWN SCAN, AND FIXED IN THE MESSAGE RATHER THAN THE GREP.** The K10 retirement banner I wrote contained the literal words a reader greps for to find dead rows, so `grep -c 'ANCHOR FAILED'` on a perfectly green run returned 1. Fourth instance of the recorded trap, after `pgrep -f`, a `/proc` loop matching the script searching it, and a log holding the Tcl that wrote it. The narrative no longer spells the strings; the anchored scan returns 0 on all four green runs and 1 on T1.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) **`0b34200`'s actual cost is UNKNOWN and no build has measured it** -- CBRUN's OOC A/B at `distributed` is now the ONLY instrument that can attribute it, so it should continue as the primary experiment rather than as a confirmation step. (2) **Whether build 12 runs at `distributed` or `regs` is a DECISION, not a finding**; `distributed` is what shipped and what the board records, `regs` is what 11b accidentally built and does not route. (3) CBRAM's syntactic-vs-semantic question is untouched. (4) `SWEEP_PIPE`/`SCORE_EARLY` have never been in a card build, above. (5) **Committing the revert BREAKS the next `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh` prepare, loudly and with instructions** -- it asserts `sha256(0b34200:matvec_core.vhd) == sha256(HEAD:...)`. Both live runs are SAFE, MEASURED: their arm trees are materialised on disk and their `MANIFEST.txt` sha256s match git (`old=ef401b6f`, `new=974734a7`, `repo_head=c189722`). Not this track's file, not edited. (6) Nothing here is a silicon measurement.
- **ADDENDUM, after `6f5c681` (CBRUN) landed: ITS NEGATIVE RESULT IS EXPLAINED AND THERE IS NO DIVERGENCE TO EXPLAIN.** CBRUN MEASURED `cb` as distributed RAM in BOTH OOC arms (`cb_ram=26112`, `cb_ff=0`, `f8` delta +0) and concluded *"no out-of-context experiment on this lever, including a `bcast` arm, can settle what it does on the card"* because *"the divergence is at synthesis"*. **The OOC ran at `CB_STYLE=distributed` -- its harness refuses `regs`, and its own `cbw_*` fanout of 1537 confirms `CB_COPIES = 1,536` -- and build 11b ran at `regs`. The two experiments differ in the generic that decides whether `cb` is RAM at all.** CBRUN's independent correction that `[Synth 8-5859]` did NOT decline `cb` (*"there is no message either way"*, count 2, both `gdn_block`) agrees with `regs`, as does `f8` delta +0 for a change that touches the WRITE path only. **Its one hit, `FF -19,345` against a registered `-19,344`, is the only number anyone has that measures this lever, and it is a SAVING** -- which still does not license it onto a card build nothing has drawn it in. **REGISTERED PREDICTION for TRACK CBCENSUS, before its draw:** build 11b's synthesis checkpoint holds **48** distinct `cb_reg` indices (max 47), **0** cells matching `REF_NAME =~ RAM*` under `cb_reg`, **6,144** `cb_reg` flip-flops, and **12,288** MUXF8 in the `cb` read cone. **Falsifier: 1,536 distinct `cb_reg` indices kills finding (b) outright.**
- **CONFIRMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TRACK CBCENSUS (`e240fbb`), FROM THE NETLIST, WHILE THIS TRACK READ THE BUILD UNIT AND THE LOGS.** Its census of `build11b_synth_bd_wrapper.dcp` MEASURED `CB_COPIES = 48`, **6,144 FDRE**, **12,288 MUXF8**, **24,576 MUXF7** and no RAM inference attempted -- matching the prediction above on every line, and the 1,536-index falsifier did not fire. **Its wording corrects mine and is the one to keep: at `regs`, `matvec_core` sets `dont_touch = true` AND `ram_style = registers` on `cb`, so the design FORBIDS the inference rather than merely not requesting it.** **HONESTY NOTE: `e240fbb` was already committed when the prediction landed (`d04a765`), so it was made in ignorance of an existing answer and is NOT a pre-registration** -- the value is that two instruments with no shared input agree to the digit, not the ordering. **What all three tracks agree is NOT established:** CBCENSUS's own words, *"what caused the -12,304 / +12,288 delta. Four parameters and five RTL files differ between the builds"* -- `CB_STYLE` is SUFFICIENT for the whole signature and is not proven the only contributor.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK DESCARM: **the DESCRIPTOR PLANE is sound at `FAST_POP=true`, and `matvec_int4_desc_axi:628` is now caught by the cadence probe and by nothing else** -- closed with NO new gate row, because a new `sim/tb_*.vhd` cannot carry its own `sim/regress.sh` flags; `:690` is measured and still open

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`, `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual.vhd`, new `sim/mutate_desc_fastpop.sh` (a `.sh`, so **no gate row**), `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-shape-a-bench-runs-at.md` sections 37-45 (appended to POPCOVER/POPPORT/KVGEOM's file, not forked), this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends) -- its one stale line is handed over below. **NOTHING in `rtl/` touched**, md5 identical at both ends: `matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd` `07973200a71574678866194e487223fc`, `async_fifo.vhd` `72dd8ff7d3e4830c0352ddd3f63ba48b`, `axi_rd_port.vhd` `5ce9d4f2136fb1c61f617698fd7f3f03`, `stream_fifo.vhd` `349a4ea8e77011c89c35dd2698ee0a98`, `matvec_int4.vhd` `2af3524ab0292a9ac790ce63b875902e`, `matvec_core.vhd` `c3325ea1f418dcbcaa85f33e47e8c901`, `weight_streamer.vhd` `4cf69b248cce7d7bdc719c03a0fcf510`. `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd` (POPCOVER) `30902816d2920a7bdff131dfe7e3ec16` and `sim/tb_weight_streamer.vhd` (POPPORT) `41fcf3f2040a10f71ff5665ee6773970` NOT opened. `hw/fk33/gen_*.py`, `tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py`, `tools/check_kv_map.py` NOT opened. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **NO VIVADO STARTED** (workstation lane on build 11b, pids 387741 and 493310 by `/proc/PID/exe`; BC-250 lane on TRACK ELABCLASS). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/descarm`, never `/tmp`. Largest process MEASURED **0.91 GB VmRSS**, `free -g` 12-14 GiB available at every launch.
- **THE ANSWER: SOUND.** MEASURED at the card's shape (`ROWS_IF=48 / AXI_DW=256`, `DUAL_CLK=true` so every FIFO is `async_fifo` with the real CDC, `FAST_POP=true`): **23 cases run, 0 failures** -- the whole 22-case descriptor mutation matrix, the legal-shape sweep on both the FK33 and the AXU3EG geometries, and the element-exact comparison against `ref/matvec_int4.c` from real packed `.mv4i` bytes. Identical at `FAST_POP=false` in the same run, which is the control that makes the pair mean anything. **Build 11b is not implicated by anything here.**
- **THE LEVER IS PRESENT AND IT IS 42 ns, MEASURED, AND THE DERIVATION SAID 50.** Descriptor AR to the job's first weight AR: shipping **528 ns**, `FAST_POP` **486 ns**. **SUPPLY CONTROL, a quantity that must NOT move: AR to the last descriptor R is 60 ns on BOTH arms** -- 10 beats at the 6 ns AXI period, so the FIFO never throttled the slave and the whole 42 ns is downstream of the supply. `DBEATS = 10` DERIVED (`8 + 24 + 3 + 4 = 39` words at 4 per beat), and 10 beats at 1.0 against 1.5 core cycles DERIVES 5 cycles / 50 ns. **It is 42.** Both endpoints are AXI-domain events bracketing a core-domain drain, so a 10 ns-quantised difference is read on a 6 ns grid; and the fill and drain interleave rather than running in sequence. **42 is a measured constant of one pinned geometry, not a law**, asserted as an EQUALITY because an inequality passes POPCOVER's P3.
- **WHY THIS IS THE ONE HONEST CADENCE WINDOW IN THE DESCRIPTOR PLANE.** POPPORT declined to time anything through `matvec_core` because the array's acceptance pattern decides when a word moves. That argument does not apply to the descriptor fetch: `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd:640` is `d_qr <= '1' when st = S_R else '0'`, so the consumer is held unconditionally open for the whole capture. **The shipping design constructs POPCOVER's "shut, then flat out" shape for free, in the state machine, on every job.**
- **NO NEW GATE ROW, AND THAT WAS THE LOAD-BEARING DESIGN DECISION.** POPPORT costed this at "a new wrapper entity and a ~50 s gate row". A new entity needs a new FILE; **rows are discovered by globbing `sim/tb_*.vhd` but `--stop-delta`, the optional `.mv4i` prerequisite and the pass marker are case arms in `sim/regress.sh` keyed by name.** A new file landing without them runs on GHDL's 5000-delta default, scores NOVERDICT, and **turns the shared gate red for every track until somebody edits the runner** -- and this track could not edit it. So the second arm went INSIDE the existing entity, inheriting flags, prerequisite and marker by construction. **The wrapper now owns the marker** (`-gMARK=false` on both arms): one arm finishing while the other hung would otherwise put the phrase `regress.sh` greps for in the log and PASS on half a run.
- **TEETH, WITH A STANDING TWO-LAYER ATTRIBUTION CONTROL ON EVERY ROW.** `sim/mutate_desc_fastpop.sh`, 13 rows x 3 benches: **OLD** (newest committed revision without the marker, found by walking back, never `HEAD~n`), **NOCAD** (`-gCADENCE=false` -- both arms, both value oracles, no timing; **no source edit at all, so unlike a sed'd control it has no anchor that can rot**), **NEW**. Result: **rows 13, pre-existing 0, card-arm 1, CADENCE 8, SURVIVED 4, anchor-failed 1.** **`pre-existing` is ZERO: not one of the thirteen is caught by the pre-DESCARM bench.** Without the NOCAD column the nine kills would have been written up as nine cadence kills; **one of them, F1, dies on a bound check the instant the fast arm is INSTANTIATED** and the probe deserves no credit for it. The 42 ns EQUALITY earns F2 (POPCOVER's P3, `528/528`, every value correct and strictly slower), D2 and F4 (`486/486`, both arms fast) **on its own -- an inequality passes all three.** The SIGN check earns D3 and F5, where the arms swap.
- **`:628` IS CLOSED. `:690` IS NOT, AND THE OBVIOUS REPAIR WAS BUILT, MEASURED AND REJECTED.** **D1 -- the descriptor master forwarding `false` while the core keeps `true`, the exact defect POPPORT named as unreachable -- dies on the new bench and nowhere else.** But **C1 and C2, the same two mutations at the CORE's site, SURVIVE every column**, registered as predicted survivors before the run. A second window (first weight AR to `job_done`, with a beat count as control) MEASURED **shipping 342 ns against `FAST_POP` 366 ns over the identical 27 beats** -- **the card's arm is the SLOWER of the two there.** The weight slaves stall on a per-port LFSR that advances once per AXI edge from reset, and the arms enter that window 42 ns (7 AXI edges) apart *because of the descriptor drain*, so they meet different stall realisations. **A "the arms differ" check would have passed on that head start alone -- including under C1 -- and would have credited `:690` for what `:628` did.** The window is printed and asserted by nothing; the beat COUNT is asserted, because a count is not a time. **The thing that caught it was that the card's arm came out slower, which had no business being true.**
- **SURVIVORS UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES, AND NONE IS A PROOF** (a worse result than POPPORT's and reported as such). **C1, C2** the real gap above. **A2** `axi_rd_port:276` into `stream_fifo`: a SCOPED gap, because this bench's only single-clock DUT is the AXU3EG arm whose weight masters are tied off. **S1** `stream_fifo`'s own fast arm, F1's exact twin, surviving purely because of which DUT instantiates which FIFO.
- **GATES.** `--only tb_matvec_fk33_desc --jobs 1` (a SUBSTRING, so all three rows): **OVERALL PASS 3 FAIL 0 NOVERDICT 0**, `REGRESSION: PASS`. `--only tb_async_fifo` PASS 1, `--only tb_weight_streamer` PASS 1, so neither neighbour moved. **THE TWO PRE-EXISTING ROWS ARE UNCHANGED TO THE NANOSECOND, MEASURED rather than argued from the defaults**: the pre-change architecture out of git ends at **732,415 ns / 23 cases / 0 failures**, and so does the new one; the `_dual` row's shipping arm still ends at **730,135 ns**. Harness self-teeth: `Z0` reports `ANCHOR FAILED -- tested nothing` and the exit contract demands exactly one such row; both refusal guards fired under test (no `.git` -> exit 2; a clone whose tree lacks the marker -> the two-sided *"OLD and NEW cannot be told apart"* refusal, exit 2).
- **HANDOVER, ONE `sim/regress.sh` LINE, NOT APPLIED.** In `tb_flags`, the comment above the three `sim:tb_matvec_fk33_desc*` rows ends `MEASURED wall clock, one core: 48.9 s, 50.9 s and 49.1 s respectively.` **That is now wrong for the middle row and was already stale for all three on this box.** Replace with: `MEASURED wall clock 2026-09-20, one core, beside build 11b: 71 s, 159 s and 71 s respectively.  The _dual row runs BOTH arms of FAST_POP in one entity (TRACK DESCARM) and cost 79 s before that, so the +80 s is one whole extra arm.` **No flag change is needed** -- `--stop-time=200ms --stop-delta=1000000` still covers it, sim end time 730,135 ns. **Optional and a real decision, not applied:** at 159 s the `_dual` row is now in `sim:tb_matvec_core`'s cost class, so whoever owns the runner may want `sim:tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual` in `SLOW_TBS` -- against which `--quick` would then skip the only row that covers the arm the card ships. Stated both ways on purpose.
- **A PRE-EXISTING DEAD HARNESS, FOUND IN PASSING AND NOT FIXED.** `sim/mutate_mv4i_desc_stale.sh` takes its DEFECT arm from `git show HEAD:rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd` and its FIXED arm from the worktree. MEASURED: both are md5 `07973200a71574678866194e487223fc`, **so the two arms are the same design and its DEFECT and CONTROL rows have tested nothing since the commit that landed the fix.** It hardcodes `HEAD` where `sim/mutate_ws_fastpop.sh` and `sim/mutate_desc_fastpop.sh` walk back for a marker -- the same control-failing-open shape those two guard against. Not a gate row, so the gate is unaffected. Not this track's file.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) **`matvec_int4_desc_axi:690` is covered by nothing** -- POPPORT proved `weight_streamer` HONOURS the lever; nothing proves `matvec_int4_desc_axi` FORWARDS it. Closing it needs a probe whose window is not confounded by the slaves' stall LFSR (a no-stall arm, or a much later and larger job), both of which change the bench's stimulus and are a decision. (2) **`stream_fifo`'s fast arm is reached by no DUT carrying weight data** in any bench (A2, S1). (3) **42 ns is one geometry**; no other was measured and the derivation that would have predicted it is the one shown to be wrong. (4) The clock ratio is 1.67x and nothing else, same as the row's pre-existing limitation. (5) **Nothing here is a silicon measurement.** (6) **`docs/LEVERBOARD.md` section 4.4 and open item 11 are now stale** (they say no `.vhd` bench sets `FAST_POP=true`); left unedited on purpose -- a shared file with three tracks live, and the read-diff-stage-commit sequence cannot be made atomic tonight.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK ELABCLASS: **the class is 16 boolean arms, not a repository-wide problem** -- the 49-second discriminator now has a table, a teeth row that reproduces HDRCOST's error in 45 s, and a 0.25 s gate row; and `A_DRAIN_WIDE`, `SWG_WIDE` and `WIDE_IO` all ELABORATE

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/elab_check.tcl` (new), `sim/elab_check_run.sh` (new), `sim/check_elab_rows.py` (new), `sim/regress_elabrows_row.patch` (new, **HANDOVER ONLY, not applied**), `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-defect-only-a-synthesiser-sees.md` (new), `hw/fk33/results/elabclass_2026-09-20/` (new), this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** -- four tracks were gating and bash re-seeks a running script by byte offset, so the row is handed over as a patch that `git apply --check` accepts against the current file. **NO `rtl/*.vhd` OPENED FOR WRITING AT ALL**; this track wrote no RTL and fixed nothing. `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`, `rtl/attn_block.vhd`, `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`, `rtl/compose4_top.vhd`, `tools/check_model_shape.py`, `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh` NOT opened. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **NO VIVADO ON THE WORKSTATION** (its lane was on build 11b); every Vivado on the BC-250, one at a time, gated on PRESENCE via `/proc/PID/exe`, capped at `MemoryHigh=11G` and never higher. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/elabclass`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE CLASS IS BOUNDED AND SMALL.** 98 entities declare 869 generics; the arm-selecting subset is **43 boolean generic names** over `rtl/` and `hw/fk33/rtl/`, of which **22 have an arm no synthesiser could have been given**, **4 sit on entities nothing instantiates** and **2 are bound by an OOC harness** -- leaving **16 reachable never-synthesised arms**. Those numbers are not transcribed into a document: `sim/check_elab_rows.py` recomputes them from the RTL on every run.
- **THE TEETH ROW REPRODUCES HDRCOST'S DEFECT IN A MODE THAT STOPS AFTER ELABORATION.** `synth_design -rtl` on the pre-fix blob (`e1d5898^:rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`) at the card's `NBLK = 8`: `ERROR: [Synth 8-11324] array index 8 out of range [.../attn_score_q12.vhd:488]`, **22 s of elaboration, 45 s of wall, cgroup peak 3,001 MB with the 11G cap never reached.** Its attribution control `c_base` -- same tree, same geometry, lever OFF -- PASSES, so the failure belongs to the lever and not to the harness. **The cheap mode was shown to have teeth rather than assumed to.**
- **ALL FOURTEEN ROWS MATCHED THEIR EXPECTATION -- `ELABCLASS_ALLDONE rc=0` -- AND THREE OF THE CANDIDATES HAD NEVER SEEN A SYNTHESISER OF ANY KIND.** MEASURED at the card's own generic map (`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd:222-243`, read from the GENERATED VHDL and not from the generator's Python): `A_DRAIN_WIDE=true` PASS 779 s; `SWG_WIDE=true SWG_LANES=1` PASS 782 s; `SWG_WIDE=true SWG_LANES=8` PASS 777 s; `NORM_ANCHOR=true` PASS 798 s; `HOST_WINDOW=true` PASS 785 s; `d_card` (the card exactly, the control every `d_*` row needs) PASS 758 s. LEVERBOARD says of L-AD *"no synthesis of any kind has seen this RTL ... no OOC draw that exists can close its cone"* and of L-S1 the same -- **elaboration is not a cone, so it can answer a question the area harnesses cannot.** Leaf rows: `WIDE_IO=true` at LANES 1 and 8 PASS 42 s each; `CHECK_JOB_INDEX=true` at the engine's twelve generics PASS 126 s; `SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` on HEAD (HDRCOST's one-line fix) PASS 243 s.
- **THE RANKING WAS BY SHAPE AND THE READING CHANGED THE ORDER.** The narrow scan finds **121 purely-static growing-index sites** -- the shape HDRCOST's defect has -- against 115 run-time-indexed ones that cannot fail this way at all. `gdn_recur_pipe.vhd` has 6 sites and three never-synthesised booleans, and ranks **LOW** because reading the code shows `D_NORM`, `TK0_ED` and `EG0_ED` appear only in `if` conditions, in no loop bound and no array bound; its six sites are the `redk`/`reda`/`redo` trees whose bound is `LOG2L` from `B_RECUR_LANES`, **which has been synthesised at 4 and at 16**. `A_DRAIN_WIDE`'s group path is the filter's own control: it indexes with `(rlane + i - lane0)`, both process variables, so it is correctly NOT in this class -- its risk is area, not elaboration.
- **AND THE 121 DO NOT ALL BELONG TO THE CARD. 67 are inside the entity closure of `fk33_card`/`fk33_llama_top`/`fk33_engine` and 54 are outside it** -- 28 of those in `rtl/layer.vhd`, whose only instantiator is `rtl/seq_ctrl.vhd`, which nothing instantiates at all. An earlier draft of this claim said "every one is already elaborated by the card build"; it was wrong and is corrected in the document rather than removed.
- **THE DELIVERABLE IS IN TWO HALVES BECAUSE ONLY ONE CAN BE A GATE ROW.** The Vivado half (`sim/elab_check.tcl` + `sim/elab_check_run.sh`) is a fourteen-row table. **It cannot run on every gate: MEASURED, the `fk33_llama_top` rows cost 758-798 s each and a DERIVED about **33 GB** -- `memory.peak` 11,812,913,152 against a `memory.high` of 11,811,160,064, so that figure is the CAP and not an appetite, beside `memory.swap.peak` 22,913,859,584. The leaf rows are 42-244 s at an honest 2.3-5.0 GB. **So: leaf rows nightly, card-top rows before any `pcieep_build.sh` that changes a generic, never beside another Vivado.** The gate half is `sim/check_elab_rows.py`: **0.25 s, 12 MB**, it recomputes the census and fails when a reachable never-synthesised arm is in neither the row table nor an EXEMPT list with a written reason. **What let `SCORE_HDR_TREE` survive was an ABSENCE, and a gate row cannot run Vivado but it can check that the absence has been acknowledged.**
- **TEETH ON THE GATE HALF, WITH ITS RESOLUTION FLOOR.** Run in a `git archive HEAD` scratch tree, never in the repository. T0 control PASS rc=0. **M1 a new one-armed boolean generic appears -> rc=1; M2 an elaboration row is deleted -> rc=1 naming `A_DRAIN_WIDE`; M3 an EXEMPT entry is deleted -> rc=1 naming `NEOX`.** **M4 SURVIVES** (a stale EXEMPT entry for a generic that no longer exists) and **M5 SURVIVES** (a row whose top does not build the generic it names) -- both reported under their own names: the row table is read as a SET OF NAMES, so **being listed is not evidence that the row elaborates that generic; only the Vivado half settles that.** Neither is fixed, and a fix for M5 would have to elaborate.
- **THE MECHANISM WAS ALREADY IN THE REPOSITORY, THREE TIMES, UNSCHEDULED.** `sim/ooc_nwfix_elabcheck.tcl` (TRACK NWFIX, 2026-08-29), `sim/elab_cardtop.tcl` (TRACK CARDTOP) and `sim/ooc_compose4_run.sh`'s `C4_STAGE=elab` all already run `synth_design -rtl` for exactly this reason. Each is hard-wired to one top and one purpose and **nothing schedules any of them**. This track did not invent the check; it gave it a table and teeth. NWFIX also pins a SECOND member of the class that has nothing to do with indices: Vivado's per-loop-statement limit of 65,536 iterations, which GHDL does not have.
- **MEASUREMENT TRAPS HIT, THREE OF THEM MINE.** (a) **A HARNESS FAILURE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A DESIGN FAILURE**: the first `d_card` run died with three anchored `ERROR:` lines naming `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` and a line number, and the cause was my own quoting -- `-generic {NAME="path"}` put the braces IN the string (`unable to open file '{"/home/.../norm_w_9b.hex"}'`). **The only thing that caught it is that `d_card` is a row which must PASS**; without that control, `d_adw` and both `d_swgw*` would have been reported as unbuildable levers. The two dead rows are kept under `rows/invalidated_quoting_trap/`. (b) **THE 11G CAP SILENTLY DID NOT EXIST**: `ssh host 'bash -s'` carries no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, so `systemd-run --user` failed and Vivado ran **uncapped on a 14 GB box with no WoL watchdog**, announced in one line nothing gates. The driver now sets both itself; **TRACK HDRCOST's driver has the same shape.** (c) **MY OWN SWAP GUARD KILLED A HEALTHY ROW**: it tripped on `/proc/pressure/memory`'s `full avg10 = 55.30`, a ten-second average, while `d_hostwin` was at 11 GB of swap -- and `d_card` had already COMPLETED at a 22.9 GB swap peak with avg10 around 5. Replaced with a level-based guard (34 GB of swap, `full avg60 > 85`), and `d_hostwin` was **re-run under it and PASSED at 785 s**, chained on batch 2's own `ELABCLASS_ALLDONE` sentinel and then gated on PRESENCE. **A guard whose threshold is a transient fails in the direction that looks like a result: `NORESULT` on the row whose verdict was the finding.** (d) The lane "looked busy" and it was busy with my own corpse: the harness's two-minute timeout orphaned a smoke run whose Vivado outlived its driver; identified by `/proc/PID/exe` and `/proc/PID/cwd`, killed by explicit PID, and the batch restarted from a clean output directory rather than merged. (e) A manifest that listed itself reported `FAILED` on a byte-correct tree.
- **MEMORY, AND WHICH FIGURES ARE HONEST.** Cap `MemoryHigh=11G`, never raised. **All six `fk33_llama_top` rows sat AT the cap** (`cgroup_peak_mb=11265-11266`), so **none of those is an appetite**; the honest figure is the cap plus each row's own `memory.swap.peak` (21,693-21,990 MB), DERIVED about **33 GB**. Every leaf row was well under the cap and those ARE appetites: teeth 3,001 MB, `c_base`/`c_tree` ~5,025 MB, `swg_*` ~2,400 MB, `a_*` ~3,300 MB. Box never left unattended: a swap guard ran beside every card-top row.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **11 of the 16 were NOT elaborated** -- `A_BEHAV`, `B_BEHAV`, `DEBUG`, `DEBUG_TAPS`, `D_NORM`, `EG0_ED`, `NEOX`, `PROBES`, `REL_NAIVE`, `STRICT_PROTO`, `TK0_ED`, each with its reason in `check_elab_rows.py`'s EXEMPT table. **A LOW rank is a judgement about ONE failure mode** and says nothing about a width mismatch, an unconnected port, or the loop-iteration limit. They are cheap rows and nobody has run them. (b) **Only the BOOLEAN space is enumerated exhaustively**; the integer side is covered only by the 121-site scan, and **no integer generic was elaborated at a non-card value by this track.** (c) `HOST_WINDOW=true` is measured only at the card's other 21 generics (PASS 785 s); `sim/elab_cardtop.tcl` elaborates the same arm at ALL DEFAULTS, a third configuration, and neither substitutes for the other. **Nothing here says any arm is CORRECT, only that it elaborates.** (d) **An elaboration PASS is not a synthesis PASS** -- `-rtl` stops before mapping, so nothing here bounds area, timing, or a `[Synth 8-10226]`-class mapping refusal. (e) **`sim/elab_check_run.sh`'s `DCARD` string transcribes the card's 22 generics and nothing gates it against `fk33_card.vhd`**; a twenty-third generic would make the table silently elaborate a configuration the card does not build, which is the recorded `compose4_top.vhd` staleness shape. A `--check` would close it and was not written. (f) The teeth row rests on ONE available defect, so "`-rtl` catches everything the full `synth_design` catches" is NOT established. (g) The 121 sites were not read individually, deliberately.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK CBRAM: **Vivado's 3D-RAM RECOGNIZER declined `cb`, and the repair is the plain revert -- build 9 ships the "broken" fanout and routes at WNS +0.061**

- **Files owned and changed:** new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-codebook-stopped-being-ram.md`, new `hw/fk33/results/cbram_2026-09-20/{README.md,ram_inference_8-5859.txt,control_sets_codebook.txt,build10_control_sets_placed.rpt.gz,build11b_control_sets_placed.rpt.gz}`, new `hw/fk33/results/card_build10_FAILED_2026-09-20/build.stdout.full.gz` (**one file added to a neighbouring directory, flagged here**), this entry. **`rtl/matvec_core.vhd` NOT touched** -- md5 `c3325ea1f418dcbcaa85f33e47e8c901` at the start and at the end, the diagnosis is the deliverable. **NOT opened for writing:** `sim/regress.sh`, `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh` / `ooc_cbooc.tcl` (CBOOC -- read and extended by REPORT only, per the brief), `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual*` (DESCARM), `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` / `gen_firstlight.py` / `tools/genstamp.py` (UPPIN), `docs/LEVERBOARD.md` (LEVERBOARD2), any RTL, any generator. **NO VIVADO STARTED** (workstation lane on build 11b, BC-250 lane on ELABCLASS). **NO HARDWARE** -- the card was live and serving throughout; `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build11b/` read-only, nothing written inside it. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/cbram`, never `/tmp`. `free -g` at start: 2 free, 12 available, 13 GiB swap.
- **THE MECHANISM, MEASURED, and it is ONE message.** `INFO: [Synth 8-5859] Recognized 3D RAM cb_reg ... [rtl/matvec_core.vhd:692]` fires in build 9 and in build 10 and **does not fire at all in build 11b**. `cb` is a 3-D array and Vivado has a dedicated recognizer for one; that recognizer is the gate, and everything downstream (the 1,536 `User Attribute | 16 x 8 | RAM32M16 x 1` rows in the Distributed RAM Final Mapping Report) follows from it. **The message fires ONCE for the whole array, so it is a decision taken on the LOOP FORM before unrolling** -- which is the only way the two builds can differ, because after unrolling `cbw_a(cb_rank_of(c))` is a constant index exactly as `cbw_a(c)` is and the netlists would be indistinguishable. **DERIVED:** the accepted pattern has the RAM-array index and every port expression indexed by the SAME loop variable; a user function call applied to the loop variable inside the index breaks it. Lines: `rtl/matvec_core.vhd:804-808` against `0b34200^:690-694`, function at `:332-335`.
- **AND THE CENSUS SAYS WHAT `cb` BECAME, which closes PLACEDIFF's open item (2).** MEASURED, `report_control_sets -verbose` at the placed stage, filtered on `.../core/cbw_v[i]`: **build 10 has 1,536 control sets of 16 bel loads each (24,576 LUTRAM bels, one RAM32M16 per copy); build 11b has 48 of 128 each (6,144 FLIP-FLOPS)**. 128 = 16 entries x 8 bits. **The 196,608 bits do not exist: the 1,536 copies collapsed to 48 banks, ONE PER RANK, and the 1,536 read ports did NOT merge** -- `MUXF8 +12,288 = 1,536 x 8`. Same-stage primitive deltas, both placed: `RAMD32 -21,528` = **exactly 1,536 x 14**, `RAMS32 -3,080` (vs 3,072), `MUXF7 +24,600` (vs 24,576), `LUT6 +55,675`, with `RAMD64E`, `DSP48E2`, `SRL16E`, `SRLC32E` unchanged to the digit. FF now closes to **1,383**: `-19,344` (cbw) `+6,144` (cb) `= -13,200` against a measured `-11,817` for all seven changes.
- **THE LOG IS NOT THE AUTHORITY AND WAS NOT TREATED AS ONE.** Build 11b's log names `cb` in **no** message of any kind (`grep -c cb_reg` = **0**, `grep -cE '[^a-zA-Z_]cb[^a-zA-Z0-9_]'` = **0**); its 101 `8-7186` are `qbuf` at `gdn_block.vhd:396`. **An absent message is a null result.** What made `8-5859` admissible is the POSITIVE CONTROL: it fires in two other builds, on the same source line, on a `matvec_core.vhd` that is byte-identical except for this change, and the two `gdn_block` rows fire in all three as the control that did not move. `xq_reg` is the in-entity control: LUTRAM inference in `matvec_core` still works in build 11b. **CLAUDE.md records `8-7186` lying about `cb[0][0]` specifically; `8-7186` is not the message that decides this and it fired for `cb` in none of the three builds.**
- **THE REPAIR IS THE PLAIN REVERT, AND I EXPECTED TO WRITE THE OPPOSITE.** MEASURED, `hw/fk33/results/card_kvreg_2026-09-20/build.stdout`, **build 9, the bitstream on the card at 2.46 tok/s**: `FK33_CB_STYLE distributed`, `8-5859` fires on `cb_reg`, 1,536 distinct indices, 3,072 `RAM32M16` rows, **`Post Routing Timing Summary | WNS=0.061 | TNS=0.000 | WHS=0.009 | THS=0.000`.** **The pre-change codebook, with the same 13 command nets of 1,536 sinks, ROUTES CLEAN and is shipping.** So build 10's `-5.819` with 17,194 failing endpoints on `cb_addr_reg -> cbw_a_reg` is a fact about **build 10's five-lever composition at 82.19% LUT**, not about the net class. **LEVERBOARD2's "MANDATORY: revert the per-row codebook" is correct and this supplies the missing half: the problem `0b34200` was written to solve is not present in the configuration that ships.** `CB_RANKS` is a derived constant, not a generic, so it must be an RTL change.
- **A CORRECTION TO LEVERBOARD2'S ESTIMATE, which it invited: the OUTCOME is right, the ORDER is wrong, and the order is what the fix depends on.** It reasoned that `dont_touch of cb` is `false` at `distributed`, so once 32 copies share a driver they *become mergeable*. The 48-bank outcome is now MEASURED and matches. But `8-5859` fires at log line 7,989 of ~30,000 **during module synthesis**, and build 11b's Distributed RAM **PRELIMINARY** report is already empty of `cb`: **the inference was refused before any merging pass ran.** Under the merge story the lever would be `dont_touch`, and setting it `"true"` at `distributed` would give **1,536 x 128 = 196,608 flip-flops**, worse than either build. **Do not reach for `dont_touch` here.** What LEVERBOARD2 contributes that this file could not: LEVERC48's independent `FF +13,195` at the same geometry against this file's DERIVED `-13,200`, which turns a one-point arithmetic fit into a corroborated one.
- **THE OOC EXPERIMENT IS SPECIFIED WITH FOUR ARMS AND FIVE FALSIFIERS, AND IT WAS NOT RUN** (both lanes held). CBOOC's harness at **`CBO_TARGET=matvec_core`**, `CBO_GEN="BLK=32 ROWS_IF=48 MAXCOLS=17408 MAXROWS_BFP=17408 CB_ROWS_PER_COPY=1 CB_STYLE=distributed"`. `old` (`0b34200^`) and `new` (HEAD) come from `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh` unchanged; `fan` and `bcast` are drawn by invoking `sim/ooc_cbooc.tcl` directly with `CBO_RTL=`, **so no edit to CBOOC's runner is needed and none was made**. Predictions registered in the write-up. **The arm that matters is `bcast`, the attribution control**: its write statement is byte-identical to `old`'s, so if restoring it does not restore the inference, my mechanism is wrong and the diagnosis must be redone rather than patched. `fan` vs `bcast` separates syntactic from semantic. ESTIMATE 10-15 min/arm, `CBO_CAP=8G`, **never above 11G on the BC-250**.
- **EVIDENCE COMMITTED BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY COPY.** The committed `card_build10_FAILED_2026-09-20/build.stdout.tail.gz` is a **tail that never reaches synthesis** -- no `8-5859`, no mapping report -- so this comparison was not makeable from the repository. The full 5.3 MB log existed only inside a reusable `BUILD_ROOT`; it is now `build.stdout.full.gz` (256 KB, uncompressed md5 `e938341e8ee6c5dbb932a18ead4996ca`, round-trip verified), together with both builds' complete control-set reports. **This is also the first TOOL COUNT of CBFANOUT's central claim on a real build: distinct `cbw_v` command nets 1,536 -> 48.**
- **MEASUREMENT TRAPS, MINE.** (1) **I nearly wrote "a revert reopens build 10's failure"** -- the brief, the commit message and the RTL comments all say so, and all three are downstream of ONE worst-path list. The control cost two minutes and was in an already-committed log. **Three documents agreeing is not a control.** (2) **I mixed the synth-stage and placed-stage primitive tables** and got `RAMD32 -20,906` instead of `-21,528`, missing the exact `1,536 x 14` fit by 622 and reading as "close but not structural". Same-stage it is exact. **The same-tree rule applies to STAGES, and staleness does not break arithmetic.** (3) A naive `awk -F'|'` on the control-set table read **field 5 (slices) instead of field 6 (bels)**, giving 48 sets summing to 1,528 -- a plausible number that is not the one the question needs; the only tell was that it was not a round multiple. (4) **My registered pre-reading prediction was wrong and is recorded unadjusted**: I predicted a generate-scope mechanism; there is no generate scope, and the recognizer that declined is one I had not heard of.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) **Syntactic or semantic** -- whether the recognizer refuses the function call in the index or refuses a shared write port. Arms `fan`/`bcast` separate them; nothing without a synthesiser does. (2) Whether `8-5859` is the ONLY gate; it is necessary, and sufficiency is an inference from three runs. (3) Whether the LUT growth is what broke build 11b's timing -- untouched, and PLACEDIFF's directive confound stands. (4) Whether the codebook fanout binds in ANY composition: build 9 routes it clean, build 10 does not, and five levers plus the placer directive differ. (5) The `S_CB -> S_START` drain state needed if `bcast` is ever taken is DERIVED from reading `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd:995-1014` and has not been simulated; that file is not mine. (6) **Build 9's placed AREA** is still unknown -- its log has the routed timing and no utilization report, so the three-build area series has a hole at the baseline. (7) Nothing here is a silicon measurement.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK LEVERBOARD2: **L-CB was recorded as free and it costs +44,073 CLB LUT** -- three board rows corrected in place, the compositions re-derived, and no lever has landed on silicon today

- **Files owned and changed:** `docs/LEVERBOARD.md` (CORRECTION 2 appended, 492 lines, **nothing above it edited or deleted**), this entry. **NOT touched:** `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` and `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-codebook-stopped-being-ram.md` (TRACK CBRAM), `sim/regress.sh`, any RTL, any generator, any `sim/` file. **NO VIVADO STARTED** (workstation lane on build 11b, BC-250 lane on TRACK ELABCLASS). **NO HARDWARE** -- the card was live and serving throughout. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/leverboard2`, never `/tmp`. Reading and arithmetic only.
- **THE CORRECTED L-CB ROW.** MEASURED, build 11b's placed report against build 10's, both `Design State: Fully Placed`: **CLB LUT +44,073** (82.19% -> **92.21%**), **MUXF7 +24,600**, **MUXF8 +12,288**, **LUT as distributed RAM -12,304**, FF -11,817, CLB +71. The board's cell read *"LUT delta UNKNOWN, not drawn"* with scope *"no synthesis at all"*; both are superseded. **The "HIGH that it is safe" confidence cell is NOT withdrawn** -- it was a statement about VALUES and nothing here touches it. **L-CB buys 0 cycles and is 128.70% of the free LUT sites build 11b has left.** It is larger than every other lever on the board added together.
- **AND A LEAD THE BOARD COULD STATE CHEAPLY, DERIVED: build 11b's codebook signature IS the `CB_STYLE=regs` signature.** TRACK LEVERC48 (`a4828ab`) measured `matvec_core` OOC at `ROWS_IF=48`, regs minus distributed: **LUT +42,633, MUXF7 +24,583, MUXF8 +12,288, LUT-as-memory -12,288, FF -13,195** (`docs/WORKLOG.md:5454`). Build 11b minus build 10: **+44,073 / +24,600 / +12,288 / -12,304 / -11,817**. Every sign agrees, four of five magnitudes to better than 3.4%, **MUXF8 to the unit**. Mechanism, ESTIMATE: at `distributed` `matvec_core.vhd:465` sets `dont_touch of cb` **false**, while `cbw_*` stay true; before `0b34200` each `cb(c)` was written from `cbw_a(c)`, **1,536 distinct undeletable drivers**, so the copies could not merge; after it 32 copies share each of 48 rank drivers and become mergeable, and a per-lane RAM32M16 read port is replaced by a per-lane 16:1 mux (4 LUT6 + 2 MUXF7 + 1 MUXF8 per bit, 1,536 x 8 times). **It also upgrades PLACEDIFF's FF reconciliation from "arithmetic that fits" to corroborated**: `-19,344 + 6,144 = -13,200` is no longer one free parameter on one data point, because LEVERC48 independently MEASURED **+13,195** for the same decomposition at the same geometry. **FALSIFIER REGISTERED:** CBOOC's harness at `CBO_TARGET=matvec_core`, `CB_STYLE=distributed`, `0b34200^` against HEAD -- if the new arm does not show `MUXF8 0 -> 12,288`, the subsection is withdrawn in full. **TRACK CBRAM owns the mechanism and `rtl/matvec_core.vhd`; the section says outright that its file is the authority over mine when it lands.**
- **REFUSED TO NET 44,073 AGAINST 42,633**, at the point of temptation and in the text. An OOC `matvec_core` draw 264 commits old and a card placed report are different synthesis contexts and *the parts do not sum*. It is a **signature match**, a statement about SHAPE, not an accounting identity.
- **THE BINDING-CONSTRAINT SECTION, PROVENANCE CORRECTED AND RE-DERIVED.** Section 4.1's `99.81% CLB, 106 free, 76,585 free LUT sites` is **`card_swg`'s**, not build 9's, which has no placed report of any kind (MEASURED by PLACEDIFF). Re-derived on the two reports that belong to the levers: **build 10 (codebook out) 82.19% LUT, 209 free CLB, 6.6001 LUT/CLB, 78,319 free LUT sites**; **build 11b (codebook in) 92.21%, 138 free, 7.3955 LUT/CLB, 34,246 free LUT sites**. Both columns close arithmetically. The lever table against the codebook-out budget: FAST_POP 0.00%, SCORE_EARLY 0.01%, SWEEP_PIPE 0.08%, the C pair 0.09%, HDR_TREE 0.65%, **B_RECUR_LANES=16 9.82%**, SWG_LANES=8 ~20.4% ESTIMATE, **L-CB 56.27%**. Section 4.2's "0 to 1,209 CLBs freed" is **not withdrawn as arithmetic** -- it was a correct bound on the FF term -- and **is withdrawn as guidance**, because the FF term was never the whole change and the measured value is 71 CLBs CONSUMED.
- **THE COMPOSITIONS RE-DERIVED ONCE, AND THEY REPRODUCE SECTION 3.4 TO THE DIGIT**, which is the check that they were re-derived rather than transcribed. `token_cycles(p) = 30,115,217 + 2,793.4 p`, absolute-subtraction slope conversion. **B0** build 9 2.490 / 2.093 / 1.415 tok/s at p = 0 / 2,048 / 8,192. **N1** = build 9 + FAST_POP with the codebook REVERTED: 2.725 / 2.256 / 1.488. **N2** = N1 + SWEEP_PIPE + SCORE_EARLY: 2.725 / 2.403 / 1.774 (+9.4% / +14.8% / +25.4%). N3 adds SWG_WIDE, N4 adds B_RECUR_LANES=16 (3.028 at p=0), N5 everything (3.387 / 2.924 / 2.074). **`B11b` and `N1` are the SAME ROW in cycles** -- the codebook contributes nothing to any column and 128.70% of the remaining LUT headroom. **DERIVED, the crossover: the intercept lever's gain and the slope pair's gain are equal at p = 2,431 (+7.56% each)**; by p=8,192 the pair is +19.2% against the intercept's +5.1%. A composition chosen on the p=0 column is chosen on the wrong column.
- **STATED PLAINLY: NO LEVER HAS LANDED ON SILICON TODAY. The shipping bitstream is still build 9 at 2.46 tok/s.** Build 10 FAILED (placed +0.421, routed **-5.819**). Build 11b is FAILING (placed **-5.136 / TNS -236,998**; MEASURED from its own live log, read-only, router at Phase 4.2 with intermediate **-4.491**, `[Route 35-448]` and `[Route 35-581]` **congestion level 6**, 1,610 CLBs with high pin utilization). **Build 11b's PLACED WNS is worse than build 10's ROUTED WNS.** A per-lever evidence table now says for each of the nine levers whether it has a value oracle, a synthesis, a placement and a route; three of them have **never met a synthesiser at all**.
- **THE RULE TONIGHT ACTUALLY PRODUCED, and it is not "compose fewer levers": DO NOT PUT RTL ON A CARD BUILD THAT NO SYNTHESISER HAS EVER DRAWN.** Two levers had scope cells reading "no synthesis" this morning. The first Vivado pointed at **L-C3** killed `synth_design` in 49 s; the first pointed at **L-CB** produced +44,073 LUT that every document about it said could not exist. Build 10 composed five and failed, build 11b composed two and is failing, and L-C2 composed with everything and routed clean -- **the discriminator is not the count, it is whether the RTL had ever been drawn.** That excludes L-S1, L-S8 and L-AD from build 12 outright and would have excluded L-CB.
- **RECOMMENDATION FOR BUILD 12.** **MANDATORY whichever levers are chosen: revert the per-row codebook.** It is at HEAD (`0b34200` / `5dc3ee5` / `9435942`), so **a card build started from HEAD today builds the +44,073 LUT netlist by default**, and `CB_RANKS` is a derived constant not a generic, so it is an RTL change (CBRAM's file, not mine). **CONTENTS: revert L-CB, plus FAST_POP, SWEEP_PIPE and SCORE_EARLY** = row N2, ESTIMATE +70 LUT (0.09% of build 10's free sites; **not MEASURED**, per CORRECTION 1's 167-LUT inter-harness gap). All three have been synthesised, one has been routed, and their three cones are disjoint so a failure is attributable -- the property build 10 and build 11b both lacked. **Considered and rejected: the single-lever build (N1).** It is the wrong trade because +70 LUT is 0.09% of the headroom and the C pair is better evidenced than FAST_POP, which still has no bench at the arm the card ships -- **but that is a judgement, not a measurement, and the mandatory part is the revert, not the composition.** **EXCLUDED with the argument in the table:** L-S1, L-S8, L-AD (never synthesised; L-AD cannot be by any existing harness), **L-B alone in build 13** (MEASURED and the largest intercept lever, excluded on SIZE at 9.82%, composing it makes the postmortem unattributable), L-C3 (cycle-equivalent at 102x the LUT).
- **EVIDENCE FROM THE WRONG CONFIGURATION, one row affected and one cleared.** (a) **L-A's `+1 CLB LUT` is drawn at `CB_STYLE=regs` and the card builds `distributed`** -- `sim/ooc_levercost_run.sh:107`'s `AGEN` carries `CB_STYLE=regs`, the card build runs `FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed`, and `CB_COPIES` is **48 against 1,536**, so the entity holds one thirty-second of the card's codebook structure. The delta is sound inside its own arm and **is not a card figure**; given that the same generic is what C2.1a says collapsed, this is not hypothetical. (b) L-A still has no `.vhd` bench at the shipped arm (SHAPEAUDIT, unchanged). (c) L-B's flat-arm `-7,545` must never be quoted, only the tier row; the LUT delta inverts sign. (d) **KVGEOM's `C_KV_BLOCK` split: CHECKED and no board row rests on it** -- no lever is parameterised by `KV_BLOCK` and no setter exists in the tree. Recorded as checked rather than assumed.
- **FOUR REFUSALS ADDED, ALL EIGHT ORIGINALS KEPT.** (9) no netting of 44,073 against 42,633; (10) **no prediction of build 11b's routed WNS** from its placed -5.136 or its intermediate -4.491, because build 10 placed at +0.421 and routed at -5.819 and **the direction of that error is the flattering one, so a bad placed number is not reassuring either**; (11) no scaling of the C pair's +69 LUT to the card; (12) no attribution of -5.136 to the +44,073, because **build 10 failed at -5.819 with 82.19% LUT occupancy**, which is direct evidence this design can fail timing badly with no LUT explosion. Original refusal 4 (not converting -19,344 FF into freed CLBs) was right for the wrong reason: the bound was sound and the quantity it bounded was not the one that mattered.
- **CLOSED since the board was written:** open items 1 and 2 (CORRECTION 1), **item 4 by TRACK BUILDREPORT `952e70a`** (`report_utilization -hierarchical` and report retention are in `gen_pcieep.py`/`pcieep_build.sh`; build 11b predates it), and the area half of item 5. **NEWLY OPEN:** build 11b's routed outcome; why `cb` stopped inferring as RAM (CBRAM); where the 196,608 bits of codebook content live (C2.1a predicts a merged 6,144 flops, a `get_cells` census on `cb_reg*` settles it); whether reverting the codebook is sufficient; **whether the 1,536-sink command net needed fixing at all** -- build 9 closed at +0.061 with it, the build-10 postmortem already withdrew the claim that area displaced it, and **the fix built for a cause that was never determined cost 44,073 LUT**; the 2.46-against-2.490 gap at p=0, whose position was never recorded; `BUFGCE 15 -> 16`.
- **Write-up:** `docs/LEVERBOARD.md` CORRECTION 2.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK UPPIN: **the build chain's root input is a file OUTSIDE this repository, there are TWO of them not one, and the one nobody found is read on every card build**

- **Files owned and changed:** new `tools/upstream_pin.py`, new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-file-outside-the-repository.md`, `tools/genstamp.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_firstlight.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_i2cprobe.py`, regenerated `hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc` + `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`, 9 citations in 5 documents, this entry. **NOT touched:** `sim/regress.sh` (line handed over below), `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` and `sim/ooc_*` (CBOOC), `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual*` (DESCARM), `tools/check_kv_map.py` / `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` (KVGEOM). **NO VIVADO STARTED** (workstation lane on build 11b, pids 387741 and 493310 identified by `/proc/PID/exe`; BC-250 lane on ELABCLASS). **NO HARDWARE** -- the card was live and serving throughout. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/uppin`, never `/tmp`. `free -g` at start: 2 free, 12 available, 13 GiB swap in use.
- **TCLOWNER'S FINDING IS CONFIRMED AND ITS RISK ORDERING IS BACKWARDS.** It named `gen_firstlight.py:19` -> `~/GitHub/SQRL_FK33/projects/fk33_example.tcl` as "the most load-bearing". MEASURED: **nothing runs `gen_firstlight.py`** (TCLOWNER measured that itself), so its external read fires only when a human re-runs it. **`gen_i2cprobe.py:42` reads a SECOND external file, `projects/fk33_example.xdc`, that neither TCLOWNER nor GENSTAMP recorded** -- and `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh:84` runs `gen_i2cprobe.py` **before every card build**, copying every upstream constraint line verbatim into `fk33_i2cprobe.xdc` -> `gen_pcieep.py`'s `XDC_SRC` -> `fk33_pcieep.xdc`, **which Vivado reads in place**. The bitstream's pin and clock constraints come from outside the repo, re-read every build.
- **`4242680` IS REAL AND IS RIGHT FOR ONE OF THE TWO FILES.** MEASURED: the clone is at `origin https://github.com/d953i/SQRL_FK33.git`, branch `Vivado_2022_2`, worktree CLEAN, HEAD `4242680b33dca856b2181c6d8fac952dd25c1946` 2022-11-07, and `git cat-file -t` says `commit`. It is also the last commit to touch the `.tcl` (blob `157ea2dd`). **The `.xdc` was last touched by `0737c22`, 2019-12-09, three years earlier** (blob `750128ed`). **"The SQRL_FK33 revision" is not one number**, and a single-commit pin would have been a false record for one of the two.
- **THE DEFECT, MEASURED WITH AN ATTRIBUTION CONTROL.** Both generators abort loudly when a substitution anchor stops matching -- which covers the lines they REWRITE (six subs, two iic lines) and says nothing about the four hundred they COPY. Mutant built from the thing: upstream `CONFIG.USER_HBM_STACK {2}` -> `{1}`, touching no anchor. **rc=0, no warning, and an emitted build script whose HBM stack count silently changed** (difflines=4). Control, same generator against the real upstream: **difflines=0**.
- **FIXED: `tools/upstream_pin.py` pins the SHA-256 of each external input and refuses.** TEETH both generators, both directions: mutated upstream -> `ABORT ... the upstream input has CHANGED` naming expected/observed/pinned revision, **rc=1**; real upstream -> **rc=0**. The pin runs before either output is written (`:217` against a first write at `:256`), so a refusal leaves the tree untouched. **No environment override, deliberately** -- an override is one more out-of-band input, which is the hazard GENSTAMP exists for; re-pinning is a source edit that lands in git.
- **THE FIX IS IN THE GENERATORS, NOT IN A GENSTAMP, AND THAT WAS A MEASUREMENT.** `gen_i2cprobe.py:40` and `gen_hbmbw.py:91` take `build_fk33_firstlight.tcl` as `SRC` and copy its text wholesale; `gen_pcieep.py:231` does the same with `build_fk33_i2cprobe.tcl`. **Inserting a stamp at the top of the root file cascades into four committed files carrying 83 line-citations**, plus the 11 TCLOWNER had just measured being broken by exactly this mechanism. Zero bytes of committed generated output changed by the pin.
- **ITEM 2 DONE, AND IT IS DURABLE RATHER THAN A ONE-OFF REPAIR.** `tools/genstamp.py` gains `append_end()`, which **refuses any block that is not comment-only** (teeth: a `set_property` line and a `--`-marked block in a `#` file both REFUSED; the `--` block with its own marker ACCEPTED). `fk33_pcieep.xdc`'s stamp now sits at the END behind a **fixed 5-line** banner. The body moved from **+19 to +5** relative to `08cc17d^`. The durable part is not the 14 lines recovered: **the stamp's height is the input count plus five, so a tenth `FK33_*` variable would have shifted every citation again, silently, for ever.** The banner is hand-written and fixed, so the body now moves only when the body moves.
- **9 OF THE 11 CITATIONS FIXED, 1 REFUSED, 1 ALREADY WRONG BEFORE THE STAMP.** Fixed in `docs/2026-08-29_pcie-reconfiguration-options.md` (x2), `docs/debugging/2026-08-28_fk33-spi-flash-boot.md` (x2), `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_build-e2e-project-run.md` (x3), `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_second-fk33-verify-and-flash-backup.md`, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_shell-pblock.md`, plus the two in this file. Every rewritten number was VERIFIED by reading the line it now points at. **REFUSED: `docs/debugging/2026-08-28_fk33-free-running-observability.md:700` cites `fk33_pcieep.xdc:177` INSIDE a fenced block reproducing Vivado's own `[Designutils 20-1307]` CRITICAL WARNING.** That is raw captured evidence about a file state that no longer exists; rewriting it would falsify a capture. **CORRECTION TO TCLOWNER: not all 11 were correct at `08cc17d^`.** `fk33-spi-flash-boot.md` cited `:122` for a comment that was at **121**; TCLOWNER verified three and generalised to eleven. Fixed to 126, which corrects both errors.
- **ITEM 3 DONE.** `gen_pcieep.py`'s `HEADER` gains a 10-line note stating that nothing builds from the committed copy (`pcieep_build.sh:89` regenerates, `:130` copies into `BUILD_ROOT`), that it is the flow's reference text and not a record of what was built, and that **the sibling XDC is different because Vivado reads THAT one in place**. All three cited line numbers verified against `pcieep_build.sh`.
- **ITEM 4 DONE: `gen_pcieep.py --check` EXISTS, with the two-prefix trap respected and a control proving the trap is real.** Environment read from the committed file's own GENSTAMP (unstamped -> ABORT, never a fallback to defaults). Regeneration via `--emit-to <dir>` -- **argv, not an env var, because `--selftest`'s `genstamp_teeth()` asserts read-set == stamped-set and a new `FK33_*` name would fail it and would be a false claim.** `HERE` is deliberately NOT redirected, so the 122 emitted source paths stay real and the comparison is about content. **TEETH, 8 rows:** control PASS; mutated tcl STALE rc=1; mutated xdc STALE rc=1; stamp stripped -> ABORT rc=1; restore -> PASS; **foreign checkout root -> OK with the root REPORTED as `<-- FOREIGN`**; foreign root PLUS a real change -> STALE rc=1. **ATTRIBUTION CONTROL: the naive fold-our-root-only canonicaliser reports unequal on the legitimate foreign checkout and the shipped detector reports equal** -- so the detection earns its keep and the row is not green-here-red-everywhere.
- **HAND-OVER, not applied (`sim/regress.sh` is not mine):** add a row running `python3 hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py --check` from `hw/fk33`, PASS on rc=0 and on a line matching `^PCIEEP_CHECK: PASS`. It currently passes; it costs one subprocess regeneration (~7 s, no Vivado).
- **MEASUREMENT TRAPS, MINE.** (1) **The mutant generator wrote its output somewhere else and the first teeth result was `difflines=0`** -- `DST` follows `__file__`, so a generator copied to the scratch root wrote there, and I diffed a file nothing had touched. The only tell was the generator's own `wrote /...` line. rc was 0 AND correct; the PATH was wrong. (2) **A `sed` mutant that matched nothing produced a byte-identical "mutant"**, caught only by an explicit `cmp -s` assertion. (3) **A `--check` teeth row failed to bite and the check was not at fault** -- the anchor exists in the XDC and nowhere in the TCL, so the mutant never landed; `grep -c` settled it. **A guard that does not fire is a claim about the mutant until the mutant is shown to have landed.** (4) `git grep` counts LINES and my census counts OCCURRENCES: TCLOWNER's 122 and `--check`'s 171 are both right about the same file.
- **Gates after, all rc=0:** `SELFTEST PASS`, `PCIEEP_CHECK: PASS`, `FK33_XDC_CHECK OK`, `FK33_CARD_CHECK: OK` x2, `GEN_CARDTOP_CHECK: OK`, `HBMBW_CHECK: OK`, `COMPOSE4_CHECK ok`. No full gate run (memory: 2 GiB free beside build 11b).
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) Whether `SQRL_FK33` should be a **submodule** -- the structurally right answer, bigger than this track, and both generators hardcode `~/GitHub/SQRL_FK33` in paths they EMIT as well as READ. (2) **Upstream `origin` was never queried** -- no `fetch`, no `ls-remote` -- so whether `4242680` is still upstream HEAD is unmeasured and the clone could be years behind. (3) The upstream **LICENSE (11,357 bytes) has not been read into the record**; it gates vendoring and nothing else. (4) **The tcl's own GENSTAMP is still at the TOP**, so `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`'s 59 citations remain exposed to the same shift-on-input-change mechanism the XDC is now immune to. (5) **75 of the 81 line-citations remain unaudited.** (6) Nothing here is a silicon measurement.
- **Write-up:** `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-file-outside-the-repository.md`.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK PLACEDIFF: **the per-row codebook costs +44,073 CLB LUTs** -- the codebook array stopped inferring as distributed RAM and became 1,536 copies of a 16:1 mux tree, and hypothesis 3's premise (a SMALLER netlist) is refuted

- **Files owned and changed:** new `hw/fk33/results/card_build11b_2026-09-20/{utilization_placed.rpt,utilization_synth.rpt,README.md}`, this entry. **Nothing else opened for writing.** `sim/regress.sh`, `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh`, `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` (CBOOC), `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual*` (DESCARM), `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `gen_firstlight.py`, `tools/genstamp.py` (UPPIN) NOT touched. **NO VIVADO STARTED. NO HARDWARE.** `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build11b/` read-only throughout; nothing written inside it. Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/placediff`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE REPORT IS COMMITTED, FIRST, BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS** (`7743d6b`). Copied read-only out of `.../build11b/root/fk33_pcieep/fk33_pcieep.runs/impl_1/bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt`, byte-identical (md5 `47c4e5e6d1f8bfe7fca22860fa8dc877` at both ends). `BUILD_ROOT` is reused; this is the third build that would otherwise have lost it. The **synthesis**-stage report was copied too and turned out to carry the load-bearing control.
- **THE ANSWER, MEASURED, build 11b against build 10, both `Design State: Fully Placed`, same Vivado 2023.2 build, same part:** `CLB LUTs 361,361 -> 405,434` (**+44,073**, 82.19% -> **92.21%**), `F8 Muxes 6,027 -> 18,315` (**+12,288**), `F7 Muxes 28,422 -> 53,022` (**+24,600**), `LUT as Distributed RAM 64,478 -> 52,174` (**-12,304**), `CLB Registers 308,213 -> 296,396` (**-11,817**), `CLB 54,751 -> 54,822` (99.62% -> **99.75%, 138 tiles free**). DSP 2,087, URAM288 32, RAMD64E 29,678, SRL16E 1,439, SRLC32E 141 **identical to the digit**.
- **DERIVED, and the fit is EXACT on one resource: `MUXF8 +12,288 = 1,536 x 8` to the unit**, where 1,536 is `CB_COPIES` at the card geometry and 8 the codebook data width; `MUXF7 +24,600` against `1,536 x 16 = 24,576`; `LUT6 +55,675` against `1,536 x 8 x 4 = 49,152`. The vanished LUTRAM splits **14 RAMD32 : 2 RAMS32 per copy** (21,528 / 3,080 measured, 14.02 : 2.005), which is one `RAM32M16` per copy -- the primitive CLAUDE.md already records `cb[0][0]` mapping to -- and the `using O5 and O6` row fell by **exactly 12,304** while `using O6 only` is **29,774 in both, unchanged**. **The codebook array `cb` stopped being distributed RAM and became a 16:1 combinational mux tree, 1,536 times over.** Nothing else in this design has the shape `1,536 x 8`, and none of build 10's five removed levers is in `matvec_core`'s cone; that fingerprint is the only thing that makes the attribution admissible against a seven-change confound.
- **IT IS A SYNTHESIS RESULT, NOT A PLACEMENT ONE, AND THAT IS PROVED RATHER THAN ARGUED.** The two builds ran **three different implementation directives** (`place_design AltSpreadLogic_high` vs `ExtraPostPlacementOpt`, `phys_opt AggressiveExplore` vs `Explore`, `route AlternateCLBRouting` vs `Explore`, MEASURED from each build's own log), so the CLB row is confounded. But `opt_design` ran bare in both, and build 11b's **synthesis-stage** report already reads `MUXF8 = 18,315`, **identical to the placed 18,315**. The mux tree exists before `opt_design` and before the placer.
- **HYPOTHESIS 3 IS REFUTED IN ITS PREMISE.** CBOOC's *"the placer's response to a netlist 19,344 flops smaller at 99.81% occupancy"*: the netlist is **11,817 flops smaller and 44,073 CLB LUTs LARGER**, at ten points more LUT occupancy. The question "why did a smaller netlist place worse" does not arise in the form asked. **What CBOOC was right about**: it predicted the answer was invisible to every instrument short of an implementation, and it was -- its own harness holds `CB_STYLE` constant and draws `matvec_int4_desc_axi`, while this effect is 1,536 copies one level down in `matvec_core`.
- **CBFANOUT'S PREDICTION IS FALSIFIED BY ITS OWN REGISTERED FALSIFIER.** Line 19 of this file: *"If LUT moves, the folding argument is wrong."* **LUT moved by +44,073.** Four of the seven resources the prediction required to be zero moved, three of them enormously. **L-CB's `LUT delta UNKNOWN, not drawn` is now known and it is large.**
- **BUT `-19,344 FF` IS NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR REFUTED, AND I WILL NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE.** That prediction is against **build 9**, and **build 9 committed no placed report** (`ls hw/fk33/results/card_kvreg_2026-09-20/` has no `.rpt`; `grep -c 'CLB LUTs' build.stdout` = **0**). Build 11b against build 10 differs by **seven** RTL/config changes, so the measured -11,817 bounds nothing about the codebook's FF term alone. LEVERBOARD's L-CB area cell stands as DERIVED and untested.
- **MY REGISTERED EXPECTATION WAS WRONG, IN THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERED.** Written to the scratchpad before the file was opened and not adjusted: FF in the band **-17,000 to -22,000** (measured **-11,817**, outside it); `abs(LUT) < 10,000`, sign likely negative (measured **+44,073**, 4.4x the bound and the opposite sign); MUXF7/MUXF8 ~0 (measured **+24,600 / +12,288**). **The prediction assumed the codebook edit was FF-only because every document describing it says so, and no document had ever synthesised it.**
- **THE CLB OCCUPANCY, which the board asked for: 54,822 of 54,960 = 99.75%, 138 tiles free. The fix FREED NO CLBs; it consumed 71 more.** LEVERBOARD 4.2 bounded the CLBs freed at **0 to 1,209**; the measured value is **-71**, outside on the low side. The bound is not withdrawn as arithmetic -- it was a correct bound on the FF term. **It is that the FF term was never the whole change**, and a bound from one resource says nothing once a second moves by 44,073. The `+71` itself is the weakest number in the file, because the placer directive differs.
- **A CORRECTION TO THIS BOARD AND TO THE BRIEF: "build 9 sat at 99.81%, 106 tiles free" IS `card_swg`'s FIGURE, NOT BUILD 9's.** MEASURED: `card_swg_2026-09-20/bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt` reads `CLB 54,854 / 54,960 = 99.81%`. LEVERBOARD section 8 item 1 attributes it correctly ("54,854 (card_swg)"); the brief collapsed it onto build 9, which has no placed report of any kind. Same cross-build borrowing the build-10 postmortem had to withdraw, one document downstream.
- **CONTROL THAT SHOULD NOT MOVE, AND DID NOT:** DSP48E2 2,087, URAM288 32, HBM_SNGLBLI_INTF_AXI 32, **RAMD64E 29,678**, RAMS64E 36, SRL16E 1,439, SRLC32E 141, LUT-as-Shift-Register 1,097 -- identical in both. `RAMD64E` is the strongest: it is the OTHER distributed-RAM family, so a 24,608-primitive collapse beside an exactly-unchanged RAMD64E localises the change. It is also the argument against `card_swg`, which reads **30,318** -- the control moves against `card_swg` and does not move against build 10. **ONE CONTROL DID MOVE AND I DID NOT PREDICT IT: `BUFGCE 15 -> 16`.** Recorded as unexplained rather than absorbed.
- **NEXT, and it is cheap.** The mechanism is inferred from a census, not from an inference log: build 11b's log carries **no RAM-inference message naming `cb` at all** (its 101 `[Synth 8-7186]` warnings are `qbuf` in `rtl/gdn_block.vhd`, subsystem B), and build 10's retained log is a **3 MB tail** that never reaches synthesis, so that comparison is one-sided and was not made. **One OOC synthesis of `matvec_core` at `a4828ab` against `5dc3ee5` at the card geometry, `CB_STYLE` held constant, settles it in minutes** -- that is TRACK CBOOC's harness, one level down from where it currently draws. Suspect, ESTIMATE only, from `rtl/matvec_core.vhd:804-807`: the write address became `cbw_a(cb_rank_of(c))`, a function of the loop variable inside the address expression.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) Why `cb` stopped inferring as RAM. (2) **Where the 196,608 bits of codebook content live in build 11b** -- not flip-flops (that would need 196,608 and FF went DOWN), not the LUTRAM that vanished. (3) Whether the LUT growth is what broke timing, or the new mux tree is itself on the critical path, or neither -- routed question, deliberately not touched. (4) Build 9's placed area, still unknown and still the control that would settle the most. (5) `BUFGCE +1`. (6) Whether removing build 10's five levers had any material area term. (7) `CARRY8 -25`, `BRAM +3`, `RAMB18 -2`, small and unchased. (8) **`FAST_POP` is untouched by this file** -- its +1 LUT / 0 FF OOC figure is neither confirmed nor contradicted, and a +1 LUT term is far below this comparison's resolution.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK CBOOC: **the per-row codebook harness is READY TO RUN, the prediction is pre-registered, and the obvious harness would have measured NOTHING** -- `CB_STYLE=regs` makes the two arms the identical netlist

- **Files owned and changed:** new `sim/ooc_cbooc.tcl`, new `sim/ooc_cbooc_run.sh`, new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_cbooc-the-codebook-has-never-met-a-synthesiser.md`, this entry. **`rtl/matvec_core.vhd` NOT touched** (md5 `c3325ea1f418dcbcaa85f33e47e8c901` at both ends -- the whole point is to measure it AS COMMITTED). **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (`91f5619a` at both ends). `sim/ooc_levercost*`, `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_hbmbw.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py`, `tools/check_kv_map.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`, `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual*` NOT opened for writing. Neither new file is a `sim/tb_*.vhd`, so **no gate row is added**. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **NO VIVADO STARTED** (workstation lane on build 11b, pids 387741 and 493310 by `/proc/PID/exe`; BC-250 lane on TRACK ELABCLASS). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/cbooc`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE OBVIOUS HARNESS IS THE WRONG-SHAPE HARNESS, AND ITS OUTPUT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A CAREFUL NEGATIVE RESULT.** DERIVED from `rtl/matvec_core.vhd`: at `CB_STYLE=regs`, `CB_LANES_PER_COPY = CB_ROWS_PER_COPY*BLK = 32`, so `CB_COPIES = 48*32/32 = 48`, `CB_RANKS = min(48,48) = 48` and `cb_rank_of(c) = (c*48)/48 = c` **is the identity** -- `0b34200` is a NO-OP there and the two arms are the SAME NETLIST. **`sim/ooc_levercost_run.sh`'s `AGEN` carries `CB_STYLE=regs`**, which is right for ITS `FAST_POP` question and fatal for this one; reusing it would have produced two complete result rows and a zero delta that was a fact about the generic. The card is `FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed` (this file, line 17; line 147 quotes the 1,536 -> 48 fanout), giving `CB_COPIES = 1536`, `CB_RANKS = 48`. `sim/ooc_cbooc.tcl` **refuses** `regs` unless `CBO_ALLOW_REGS=1`.
- **AND `matvec_core` DOES NOT CLOSE BUILD 10's FAILING PATH.** Build 10's ten worst paths were `cb_addr_reg[i]/C -> cbw_a_reg[c][i]/D`. The endpoint is inside `matvec_core`; the STARTPOINT is not -- `cb_addr` is an input PORT there (`rtl/matvec_core.vhd:81`) and at `matvec_int4` too (`:95`), and the register is `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd:474`, assigned at `:1002`. So `matvec_core` closes the FANOUT cone and `matvec_int4_desc_axi` is the **smallest entity holding both endpoints**. Default target is `matvec_int4_desc_axi`; `CBO_TARGET=matvec_core` is the cheaper draw and is valid for area and fanout only. **The two contexts must not be summed.**
- **THE PREDICTION IS WRITTEN DOWN AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED.** DERIVED at the card shape, 13 command bits (1 valid + 4 addr + 8 data): `cbw_*` flip-flops `13*1536 = 19,968` -> `13*48 = 624`, **delta -19,344**; **delta LUT = 0** (`cb_rank_of(c)` takes the generate-loop constant and folds, so no mux is inferred); **delta LUTRAM / DSP48E2 / RAMB36 / CARRY8 / MUXF7 / MUXF8 = 0**; max `FLAT_PIN_COUNT` on the `cbw_*` D nets **1,537 -> 49** (1,536 -> 48 sinks) with the count of distinct such nets **13 in both arms, as a CONTROL**. **If LUT moves, the folding argument is wrong. If the FF delta is not -19,344, CBFANOUT's central DERIVED number is wrong and LEVERBOARD's L-CB row must be withdrawn** -- which is a result this harness can produce and the lead cannot.
- **WHAT IT CANNOT SETTLE, SAID IN ADVANCE: it cannot exonerate or convict the change on build 11b's WNS.** That is a PLACEMENT outcome at 99.81% CLB occupancy; this file already records `phys_opt` over-promising by 0.4-0.6 ns and INVERTING a verdict, and an OOC route does not transfer because OOC congestion is not the card's congestion. Synthesis IS sufficient for the question actually asked, because the claimed mechanism is a fanout COUNT and the registered prediction is a flip-flop COUNT, both netlist facts fixed at `synth_design`. A post-`opt_design` checkpoint is written per arm so a routed follow-up costs a `read_checkpoint`, not a second synthesis.
- **VALIDATED WITHOUT A SYNTHESISER, AND THE GUARDS WERE SHOWN TO BITE.** The Tcl was EXECUTED end to end under a stub harness that replaces every Vivado command (`stub_check.tcl` in the scratch): reaches `CBOOC_DONE`, reads 110 VHDL files, excludes the four `ooc_*_top.vhd` harness tops, and its Intra Clock Table parser skips the table's own `-----` separator -- the token that has twice taken a 735 s draw down after everything succeeded. Guards fired: `CBO_TARGET` unset; an `rtl/` with no `matvec_core.vhd`; `CB_STYLE=regs` refused **and** `CBO_ALLOW_REGS=1` still reaching `CBOOC_DONE`; a stubbed-empty `get_cells` giving "that is not an answer, it is a broken filter"; a base commit whose parent already carries the change (`0 files differ`); a base commit where the file has moved since (both sha256s printed plus the `git apply -R` recipe); an unknown `CBO_TARGET` refused rather than drawn on defaults; a tampered import; an import with no manifest. **DID NOT BITE, under its own name:** the "the one differing file is not `matvec_core.vhd`" branch is unreachable by construction and is NOT a guard with demonstrated resolution.
- **THE TREES, MEASURED.** `diff -rq old/rtl new/rtl` names exactly one file; `diff -u | grep -c '^@@'` = **4** = `git show 0b34200 -- rtl/matvec_core.vhd | grep -c '^@@'`. old sha256 `ef401b6ff079e055...` == `0b34200^:rtl/matvec_core.vhd`; new `974734a743f73201...` == `HEAD:`. The reverted arm is the REAL pre-change RTL, not an imitation, which is the `seam_tieoff_teeth` lesson.
- **BOTH ARMS ELABORATE AT THE CARD GEOMETRY, AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS THE DISCRIMINATOR.** MEASURED, GHDL 1.0.0 mcode, 4 rows: old prints `CB_COPIES=1536 CB_LANES_PER_COPY=1 CB_WR_LAT=1` and **no `CB_RANKS` at all**; new prints `CB_RANKS=48` beside it. The `matvec_int4_desc_axi` rows additionally show the string generic arriving through TWO hierarchy levels. **Do NOT gate this on an exit code:** both arms elaborate and then fail at time 0 with `overflow detected in process .matvec_core(rtl).P7`, because a datapath unit run as a TOP has `integer` ports at `integer'left`. Identical in both arms, not an elaboration failure, and gating on rc would have failed both and looked like a finding.
- **THE LANE AND THE BUDGET.** Send it to the **BC-250** at `CBO_CAP=8G`: LEVERCOST's IDENTICAL draw (`matvec_int4_desc_axi`, same card geometry) ran there twice to `rc=0`, wall **713 s / 725 s**, `hw/fk33/results/levercost_2026-09-20/arms/mem_apop_*.txt`. **Both of those `cgroup_peak_mb=8195` figures are `at_cap=YES` and are the CAP, not the appetite**; the honest size is Vivado's own `Memory (MB): peak` ~**4,050 MB** (that README, line 640), and the 10.0 GB RSS sum double-counts shared pages across forked workers. ESTIMATE **12-20 min per arm at `distributed`**, 25-40 min for both -- it is a different netlist from the `regs` rows and the OLD arm carries 19,968 extra flops. **`CBO_CAP` MUST NOT EXCEED 11G there**; a 12G cap made that 14 GB box unreachable and it is on no WoL watchdog.
- **AND THE BC-250 CANNOT BUILD ITS OWN ARMS, WHICH IS WHY IMPORT MODE EXISTS.** `~/GitHub/DevOps/bc250-sync-llama-vhdl.sh` rsyncs the git-TRACKED files only and copies **no `.git`**, so `git archive HEAD` and `git show 0b34200^:...` both fail there. Prepare here (`CBO_PREPARE_ONLY=1`, ~6 s, safe beside build 11b), rsync the run directory, draw with `CBO_IMPORT=<dir>`; the provenance git would have asserted is written to `MANIFEST.txt` at prepare time and re-checked by sha256 at import, because internal consistency cannot detect staleness. Its shell is fish, so wrap in `bash -s`. Resolve its address from the router lease, never from a hardcoded number.
- **NEXT, branched before the answer.** delta FF = -19,344 and delta LUT ~ 0 and fanout 1,537 -> 49 -> **the lead is weakened**; attribution moves to `FAST_POP` (unbenched, this file line 154) or to the placer's response to a smaller netlist, and the next instrument is build 11b's own placed utilization report (line 103), not another OOC draw. delta LUT materially positive, or a new high-fanout net in the name-independent top-N, or a worse `cbw_*` path class -> **the lead is supported** and the next step is the `matvec_core` draw to localise it. delta FF not -19,344 -> **stop and withdraw LEVERBOARD's L-CB area cell** before anything else; that is a defect in the board independent of build 11b.
- **OPEN, not determined:** everything in the prediction -- no synthesiser has run and the numbers are DERIVED. Whether `FAST_POP` costs anything at `CB_STYLE=distributed` (held CONSTANT at `true` here, so this harness is silent on it; LEVERCOST's `+1 CLB LUT` is a `regs` number and the contexts do not sum). Whether build 11b's collapse is attributable to either lever at all -- the third candidate, the placer's response to a netlist 19,344 flops smaller at 99.81% occupancy, is invisible to every instrument short of a re-implementation from build 11b's own checkpoint. The runtime and memory at `distributed` are ESTIMATEs extrapolated from `regs` draws on a different netlist.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK TCLOWNER: **the committed `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` really does build nothing, and the answer is still KEEP IT** -- four of six committed build artefacts have a machine consumer, three of them as the next generator's input, and the bisect argument survives at 3 of 3 sampled commits

- **Files owned and changed:** `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-tcl-nothing-builds-from.md` (new) and this entry. **NOTHING ELSE. No file was removed, no generator, tcl, xdc or `sim/regress.sh` was opened for writing** -- this track's deliverable is a recommendation, and `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `tools/genstamp.py`, `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`, `hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc`, `rtl/matvec_core.vhd`, `sim/ooc_*` and `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual*` were not touched. `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_generated-files-record-their-inputs.md` NOT extended -- a separate file, because that one answers a closed mechanism question and this is a live retention decision. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK ELABCLASS). Every regeneration ran in a `git archive` tree under `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/tclowner`, never in the checkout, so the repo's committed bytes are unchanged (`build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` md5 `474449e95a39d2b69683a598962e73cb` at both ends).
- **THE RECOMMENDATION IS "KEEP ALL SIX, CHANGE NOTHING TODAY".** The premise GENSTAMP and GENGATE reported is correct and the conclusion does not follow. MEASURED: the chain is `fk33_example.tcl` (**external repo**) -> `build_fk33_firstlight.tcl` -> `build_fk33_i2cprobe.tcl` + `fk33_i2cprobe.xdc` -> `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` + `fk33_pcieep.xdc`, and **every committed intermediate is the next generator's `SRC`** (`gen_i2cprobe.py:40`, `gen_hbmbw.py:91`, `gen_pcieep.py:231`, `:233`). Deleting any of the three breaks the build outright. **The "nothing reads it" claim is true of exactly two leaves**, `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` and `build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl`.
- **`build_fk33_firstlight.tcl` IS THE MOST LOAD-BEARING ARTEFACT IN THE SET AND NOBODY HAS BEEN ARGUING ABOUT IT.** `gen_firstlight.py:19` reads `~/GitHub/SQRL_FK33/projects/fk33_example.tcl` -- **outside this repository**, `origin github.com/d953i/SQRL_FK33`, HEAD `4242680`, and **nothing in this repo records which upstream revision the committed file came from.** MEASURED: it reproduces byte-exactly today, only because that clone happens to sit at that path at that revision. The next `git pull` there is an unobserved variable.
- **THE BISECT ARGUMENT SURVIVES, MEASURED AT 3 OF 3 COMMITS, UNDER THREE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS.** `git archive` the tree, run `gen_i2cprobe.py` then `gen_pcieep.py`, path-normalise, diff against `git show <c>:...`: `ed1ffe2` (08-29) **difflines=0 at the defaults**; `a182f9a` (09-08) **0 at the defaults, 420 at today's triple**; `46ae46b` (09-18) **445 at the defaults, 16 at the triple, 0 at `FK33_CARD=1` alone**. The generator at an old commit runs and is faithful; **the environment was the entire difficulty**, which is precisely the tax the stamps abolish from today forward. For commits before `08cc17d` the committed output remains the only record -- and git keeps those bytes whatever is decided now, so removing the file removes nothing from history.
- **BUT THE FILE IS NOT AN ARCHIVE OF ANY BUILD, AND THAT IS THE HONEST WEAKNESS.** `pcieep_build.sh:84-89` regenerates before every build, so what built is the generator plus the **build's** environment. At `46ae46b` the committed file records the environment of whoever last regenerated (`FK33_CARD=1` alone), which need not be any build's. The thing that answers "what was built" is `PROVENANCE.txt` (`pcieep_build.sh:160-179`, `git_head` + `git_dirty` + `env | grep ^FK33_`) -- and MEASURED, **`find hw/fk33/results /mnt/storage/fk33_builds -name PROVENANCE.txt` returns NOTHING.** The harvest landed today and no build has completed through it. **A middle option resting on a zero-times-observed mechanism is not today's answer**, which is why "write it to the report directory instead" is rejected rather than adopted.
- **A `--check` FOR `gen_pcieep.py` IS NOT BLOCKED BY THE ABSOLUTE PATHS -- IT IS UNWRITTEN.** MEASURED at HEAD in an isolated tree: regenerate under the stamped triple, fold the prefix with one `sed`, and the tcl and the xdc are both **difflines=0**, so the committed pair is currently in sync. The idiom is already in the repo: `gen_fk33_card.py`'s `_canon_hexpaths` folds the repo prefix to `@REPO@` and **reports** the observed prefix rather than checking it. **THE TRAP FOR WHOEVER WRITES IT: THERE ARE TWO PREFIXES.** `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl` x122 and `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/SQRL_FK33` x2 (`:183 set scriptPath`, `:208 set sourceRoot`), the second inherited down the chain and pointing **outside the repo**. Folding only the first gives a row that is green on this box and red everywhere else -- the muted-row failure GENGATE's attribution control exists to prevent.
- **A NEW COST, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE COMMIT WITH NO CONFOUND: THE GENSTAMP BLOCK BROKE ALL 11 LINE-NUMBER CITATIONS INTO `fk33_pcieep.xdc`, BY EXACTLY 19.** `git diff 08cc17d^ 08cc17d -- hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc --numstat` is 19 inserted at the very top, 0 deleted. Verified three: `BITSTREAM.GENERAL.COMPRESS` cited `:127`, **correct at `08cc17d^`**, now 146; `pblock_bd_i` cited `:133-140`, correct then, now 152; `EXTMASTERCCLK_EN` cited `:122-123`, correct then, now 141. **This is different in kind from the tcl citations, which GENGATE correctly reported as ALREADY wrong** (independently re-verified here: `:781-782` was 902 at `08cc17d^` and is 942 now; `:251` was 372 and is 412). Not an argument against the stamp -- an argument for emitting the block at the END of a constraints file, where an insertion shifts nothing anyone cites. Recorded, not fixed: `tools/genstamp.py` and `gen_pcieep.py` both have owners tonight.
- **WHAT COMMITTING IT BUYS, EACH CLAIM ASSESSED RATHER THAN LISTED.** (1) *reviewable configuration* -- partly real and currently **inverted**: the last regeneration was `+133 -6` of which **117 lines were three other tracks' drift**, so the diff misattributes rather than exposes; the 16-line stamp is what exposes it. (2) *`git log` records the flow* -- **false as stated**: it records when somebody happened to regenerate, batched and lagging; `git log hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` (42 commits) is the accurate history. (3) *readable without running a generator* -- **REAL, and the strongest**: **59** line-cites point into `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` and **22** into `build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` from tracked non-results files, and `docs/2026-08-27_hbm-residency-map.md` quotes `build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl:483-738` as *the evidence* for the 30-port HBM map. (4) *the artefact a bisect needs* -- **no**, see above.
- **MY OWN TRAP, AND IT WOULD HAVE PRODUCED THE OPPOSITE RECOMMENDATION.** The first bisect run reported `RUNFAIL` at all three commits and I nearly recorded "the generator at old commits does not run". It runs. The abort was `ABORT: the probe build script no longer contains: add_files ... fk33_i2cprobe.xdc` -- before TRACK PATHFREE (`3219cb0`) the anchor was an **absolute path**, so it matches only in a checkout at the canonical location. The fix is one prerequisite line, `python3 gen_i2cprobe.py`, which `pcieep_build.sh:84` already runs. **A failed reproduction measures the harness, not the job.**
- **TWO COUNTING TRAPS.** `git grep -c 'fk33_pcieep.xdc:[0-9]+'` returns **115** and **104 of those are Vivado warnings inside archived `build.stdout` files**; the honest figure is **11**. And `.claude/worktrees/` holds full untracked copies of the repo, so a plain `grep -rn` returns every generator two or three times. Use `git grep`, and exclude `hw/fk33/results/` from every citation count.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **75 of the 81 line-number citations are unaudited**; I verified six and all six were wrong. Whether they should become anchor-text citations is a separate decision with a real cost and was not made. (b) **Whether `NPORT=30` / `FCLK_MHZ=300` is the configuration anything wants** -- GENSTAMP's open item, still open. (c) **Whether the committed `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` would build off this machine** is **DERIVED from the text, not MEASURED**: the two `SQRL_FK33` absolute paths survive regeneration in any directory, and no Vivado was started. (d) **Whether a two-prefix canonicalising `--check` has teeth** -- the `gen_fk33_card.py` precedent does; my `sed` had no mutant behind it. (e) Whether `PROVENANCE.txt` captures what it claims: **zero instances exist**. (f) Nothing here is a silicon measurement and no build was run.
- **FOLLOW-UPS FOR OTHER OWNERS, none applied.** `gen_pcieep.py`'s `HEADER`: three sentences saying plainly that nothing builds from the committed copy (`pcieep_build.sh:84-89` regenerates it, `:130` copies the result), so a reader stops treating it as the build. `gen_pcieep.py`: a two-prefix canonicalising `--check` plus one `regress.sh` row. `tools/genstamp.py`: end-of-file placement for constraint files. `build_fk33_firstlight.tcl`: pin the upstream SQRL revision it was derived from. **Full record and the per-file recommendation table: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-tcl-nothing-builds-from.md`.**

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GENGATE: **GENSTAMP's handover applied, and the committed `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` turned out to be 117 lines behind its own generator** -- three ungated generators now have two-directional `--check` modes, two of which recover their argument from the stamp because their default reports STALE on a correct tree

- **Files owned and changed:** `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` (GENSTAMP's patch plus a `genstamp_teeth()` selftest row), `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` and `hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc` (regenerated under the RECOVERED environment), `tools/genstamp.py` (`parse` / `read_inputs` / `value`, additive), `tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py` and `hw/fk33/gen_hbmbw.py` and `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py` (`--check`), a dated section appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_generated-files-record-their-inputs.md` (GENSTAMP's file, extended in place), this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends of every window; three tracks were gating and bash re-seeks a running script by byte offset) -- the three row additions are written out verbatim in the debugging file for that file's owner, and were verified end to end against a COPY. `rtl/hbm_tg_ip.vhd` (`1fa271d7b976f236b8f0fe79c68e3e60`), `hw/fk33/build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` (`263544372deca43966575c887c0e3ad6`) and `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` (`0da4b4b6e20897e146eb23ec02cf7b77`) **identical at both ends** -- every `--check` was proven not to write. `rtl/compose4_top.vhd`, `hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py`, `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`, `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`, `tools/check_kv_map.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK ELABCLASS). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/gengate`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE ENVIRONMENT IS `FK33_CARD=1 FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75`, AND ALL THREE ARE LOAD-BEARING.** MEASURED, path-normalised against the committed file: 123 changed lines at that triple, **125** without `FK33_CB_STYLE`, **137** without `FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ`, and **641** (145 +, 496 -) at the defaults. The 75 MHz `CLKOUT3` that TRACK BUILDREPORT could not reconstruct is `ENG_CORE_MHZ` at `gen_pcieep.py:3667`.
- **AND THE 123 RESIDUAL LINES ARE NOT CONFIGURATION -- THEY ARE THREE PENDING GENERATOR CHANGES THAT NOBODY REGENERATED.** `+24` the `tgRoot` block and its six `$tgRoot` substitutions (`3219cb0`, TRACK PATHFREE), `+70` the post-place report hook, `+23` the routed hierarchical utilization report (both TRACK BUILDREPORT, today). **Zero lever-C lines move and zero clock lines move**, which is what makes the environment settled rather than merely plausible. The handover's estimate of "roughly `+12 -0`" was right about the stamp and did not know about the drift; the real figure is `+133 -6`, of which **16 is the stamp and 117 is the drift**. That drift sat in the one generated file nobody could regenerate safely, which is the exact failure this track exists to make visible.
- **THE XDC GETS THE SAME NINE ROWS, NOT AN EMPTY STAMP.** The handover offered `[]` "if it does not depend on the environment". MEASURED that it does: `FK33_ENG=0` moves **35 body lines** (`ENG_XDC` selects the other block) and `FK33_ENG_SPLIT_CLK=1` adds **8**; `FK33_CARD`, `FK33_CB_STYLE` and `FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ` move zero, sha256 identical. An empty stamp would have been the `fk33_bc_grant.vhd` false-claim failure again. The XDC also had **no banner at all** before this -- its first line is SQRL's, so nothing said it was generated.
- **THREE `--check` MODES, EACH WITH TEETH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** MEASURED runtimes **0.025 s / 0.017 s / 0.017 s**. `HBMTG_CHECK`: control OK, a body line -> STALE, **the stamp changed to `NPORT=16` while the body stays 30 -> STALE** (which is what proves the stamp is read), the stamp removed -> **ABORT, not a default fallback**. `HBMBW_CHECK`: the same four. `GEN_FK33_ENGINE_CHECK`: control OK, **`FAST_POP` flipped true -> false -> STALE** with the diff naming it, the file deleted -> STALE. `FAST_POP` is the mutant on purpose: it is the lever build 11b carries.
- **THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL IS THE ARGUMENT FOR READING THE STAMP AT ALL.** The same check with the generator's DEFAULT argument, on the same current tree: `python3 tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py --check 16` -> **STALE rc=1**, `python3 hw/fk33/gen_hbmbw.py --check 15 300` -> **STALE rc=1**. A row that is red on a correct tree gets muted, and a muted row is the "regenerated by a script nothing runs" defect with extra steps. The committed values (30, and 30 300) are recoverable only because GENSTAMP stamped them this morning.
- **`gen_pcieep.py --selftest` GAINED A ROW AND IT BITES THREE WAYS.** Control `read=9 stamped=9`. Mutants, each built from the THING: a real read site left unstamped (`FK33_FLATTEN` dropped) -> FAIL; a real name nothing reads (`FK33_PHANTOM` added) -> FAIL; a real non-determinism (`os.getcwd()` spliced into the reproduce command) -> FAIL naming the path. All three are edits to code that did not exist before this change, so no pre-existing row is being credited.
- **THE `--help` WRITE IS CLOSED, and it was a small change.** MEASURED in a pristine scratch tree with the mtime pinned to 2000-01-01: `python3 hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py --help` printed `wrote ... (91191 bytes)` and the mtime became today. After: `--help` prints usage and writes nothing, `--chek` prints usage and returns **2** rather than silently regenerating, and the file's md5 is unchanged across all three.
- **THE SELF-MATCH TRAP FIRED A FOURTH TIME, INSIDE THE FUNCTION WHOSE DOCSTRING SAYS THE HAYSTACK CANNOT HOLD THE NEEDLE.** The env-name scanner's pattern is escaped so it cannot match itself -- correct, and written down -- and then the MUTANT was spelled out as one literal in the same file, putting a real-looking `os.environ.get("FK33_...` read site in the text being scanned. The control run reported `read=10 stamped=9` and exited 1 on a clean tree. **Escaping the needle is not enough if you also write an unescaped copy of it nearby.**
- **GATES, md5 windows matched at both ends.** In the real checkout, six self-check rows, `--jobs 1`, every `OVERALL` line read: `runguard`, `ipsync`, `c4stale`, `gdnstale`, `shapemirror`, `fk33card`, all **`OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`**. Plus `hw/fk33/check_pcieep_xdc.py` -> `FK33_XDC_CHECK OK` against the restamped XDC. In the scratch tree with the three new rows applied to a COPY of the runner: `--only stale` -> **`OVERALL PASS 5 FAIL 0`**; then one line appended to each of the three targets -> **`OVERALL PASS 2 FAIL 3`** with `c4stale` and `gdnstale` as the controls that did NOT move.
- **MEMORY.** `free -g` before every run, beside build 11b (PID 493310, 12.4 GiB, cwd `impl_1`): **12-13 GiB available**, swap 13 of 31 throughout. The largest thing this track ran is a Python process; no GHDL bench, no Vivado, no full gate, `--jobs 1`, targeted `--only` only. `ls -l /proc/PID/fd | grep -c llama.vhdl` = **0** for both Vivado PIDs, so nothing this track wrote could reach the live build.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **`hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` still has no `--check`** and is now the only committed generator in this class without one; the reader exists and works on its stamp, but the generator writes ABSOLUTE `add_files` paths for 104 sources, so such a check would pass only in the checkout that wrote the file -- a `$tgRoot`-relative source list is TRACK PATHFREE's territory and half-done. (b) **Whether `NPORT=30` (and `FCLK_MHZ=300`) is the configuration anything currently wants** was flagged by GENSTAMP, deliberately not answered here; a `--check` is a staleness test, not an endorsement. (c) **The 117 lines of drift now committed have never been through a build** -- the committed copy's only consumer is a human, because `pcieep_build.sh:89` regenerates before every build; called out rather than absorbed. (d) **Three comments in this repo cite `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` by LINE NUMBER and all three were ALREADY WRONG at HEAD** (`host/fk33_run_token.py:86` cites `:781-782` for something at 902; `tcl/axi_select.tcl:45` cites `:251` for something at 372); this regeneration moves them a further +40. Recorded, not fixed -- they belong to other files, and a line-number citation into a generated file is stale by construction. (e) **`hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` remains unstamped** (TRACK GATERED). (f) **The `c4stale` comment block in `sim/regress.sh` now contains two false statements** about `gen_fk33_engine.py` ("still does not" have a `--check`, "even `--help` rewrites the repo file"); the correction is in the handover block and must be applied by that file's owner. (g) Nothing here is a silicon measurement and no build was run.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK KVGEOM: **`check_kv_map.py` was reading the GENERATOR, not the card** -- the `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK` split is real and wider than reported, the address map was never at risk, and the one row it defeated was the only row it could

- **Files owned and changed:** `tools/check_kv_map.py` (side 4 rewritten against the artifact, provenance row added, 15 new teeth rows), `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` (comments and the trim banner corrected -- **output byte-identical**, `--check` rc=0 after), `sim/realshape_gate.sh` (one stale comment: "17 rows" -> 44, and the side list), a new dated section 30-36 appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-shape-a-bench-runs-at.md` (SHAPEAUDIT's file, extended in place as POPCOVER and POPPORT did), this entry. **`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` NOT touched** -- the committed artifact is unchanged and still at the defaults. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends of every window). `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_hbmbw.py`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py`, `rtl/compose4_top.vhd`, `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`, `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK ELABCLASS). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/kvgeom`, never `/tmp`. `free -g` 12-13 GiB available at every run; the largest thing this track ran is a Python process.
- **THE SPLIT, ESTABLISHED FROM THE CODE AND WIDER THAN GENSTAMP REPORTED.** Side 4 -- added 2026-09-09 *because* the card had been built with `llama_top`'s toy defaults -- read `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`'s SOURCE TEXT and printed the word **"built"** about the result. The generator is not built. `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` is: it is committed, and `gen_pcieep.py:1274` puts it in `_CARD_ALL` -> `CARD_RTL_ADD` -> the `read_vhdl` list of the generated build script (`:3400`). So **three** routes diverge the two, not one: the env trim, a stale artifact, a hand-edit. **MEASURED**: with the artifact regenerated at `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16` so that `:244` reads `C_KV_BLOCK => 16,`, the old checker printed `built 32 vs simulated 32` and `40 rows, 0 refused`.
- **DOES IT MATTER? TWO ANSWERS, POINTING OPPOSITE WAYS, AND BOTH ARE THE RESULT.** (1) **For the address map this file guards, the trim is HARMLESS, MEASURED not shrugged.** `kv_record_bytes = 16 + HEAD_DIM*CM_W/8 = 272` carries no `KV_BLOCK` term, so every base, extent, overlap and pseudo-channel row is invariant; the only two `KV_BLOCK`-dependent rows hold at **every** member of the legal set {16,32,64,128} (NBLK 16/8/4/2), and everything outside it is refused by `gen_fk33_card.py`'s own `LEGAL` table in one second. The RTL is internally consistent at all four -- `attn_block:1098` passes `DIM_TILE => KV_BLOCK, ACC_N => NBLK` and `:1120` `NBLK => NBLK`, all from the one generic. (2) **For the row that exists specifically to catch build/sim divergence, it is fatal.** Six generics are compared against the KVR block; **exactly one, `C_KV_BLOCK`, has a supported mechanism in this tree for making the build differ from the simulation, and that is the one the row could not see.** The other five are correct by the accident of having no trim.
- **AND THE TRIM IS NOT THE HARD CASE -- `sim:fk33card` CANNOT SEE IT EITHER.** `gen_fk33_card.py --check` catches a stale or hand-edited artifact **only with the environment unset**. MEASURED: in a shell exporting `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16` -- the shell a trimmed build is run from, and the only shell in which a trimmed artifact is legitimate -- `--check` regenerates WITH the trim, matches, prints `OK`, rc=0. **Both `sim:fk33card` and `sim:kvmap` green while the card is at 16 and the KVR block simulates 32.**
- **THE TREE-LEVEL ATTRIBUTION CONTROL, 4 artifact states x 3 checkers, and it is what stopped an over-claim.** `trim16`: fk33card(unset) **1**, fk33card(env=16) **0**, kvmap **1** -- the hole, and the new rows are the only thing that sees it. `A_ROWS_IF 48->24, clean stamp`: fk33card **1/1**, kvmap **0** -- kvmap does NOT catch it and `sim:fk33card` does, so that hole is covered elsewhere and this checker must not claim it (kept as a named DOES-NOT-BITE teeth row). `C_MAXPOS 4`: both catch it. CONTROL: kvmap 0. **And the complementary direction `--check` can never cover**: a generator edit REGENERATED CONSISTENTLY (`C_MAXPOS` 65536 -> 131072) leaves `--check` at rc=0 and is caught only by `built card C_MAXPOS == KVR C_MAXPOS`. **The two rows are complementary; neither is redundant.**
- **WHAT CHANGED.** Side 4 now reads `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd`'s `entity work.fk33_llama_top generic map` for every value -- `read_card`, `_read_int_generic`, `_read_bool_generic`, `C_N_ROT` -- and REFUSES if that instantiation is absent rather than falling back. A 41st row reads the artifact's GENSTAMP block and refuses on any input that is not `(unset)`, which is the only thing that can ever see an `A_ROWS_IF` trim (no KVR authority exists for it). **A trimmed tree now makes `sim:kvmap` REFUSE, and that is the correct verdict, not a regression:** the built geometry and the KVR block describe different designs, which is the 2026-09-09 condition. The generator's banner and its "check_kv_map validates the DEFAULTS and will NOT see this" comment were corrected in place.
- **TEETH: 29 -> 44, and SIDE 4 HAD ZERO BEFORE TODAY.** Every one of the 29 pre-existing mutants reaches the gate block, the RTL, the shape or a manifest; not one touched the card. **Every side-4 mutant is a REAL `fk33_card.vhd` written to disk and parsed by the real reader** -- a substituted dict would pass identically against the OLD code and therefore cannot detect the misconception under test (CLAUDE.md's `seam_tieoff_teeth()` lesson: build the mutant from the THING). The trim mutant is byte-shaped like what the generator really emits: MEASURED, a really-generated trimmed artifact differs from the committed one in exactly the three lines the mutant edits. **Attribution control**: the same trimmed artifact with `card_rows=False` is ACCEPTED, so nothing else in the checker sees it. The two halves are separated too -- value-only and stamp-only each refuse alone.
- **TWO TRAPS FOUND IN THE READER WHILE WRITING IT.** (a) **`A_JOB_STRIDE => 16#40000#` is already in that generic map**, and a decimal-only `(\d+)` regex reads **16** out of it -- a silent 16x error of exactly the class side 4 exists to catch, sitting in the file the new code had to start parsing. The reader enumerates the decimal and based forms and refuses anything else; paired teeth `16#10000#` (ACCEPTED, same 65536) and `16#10001#` (REFUSED) prove it reads the VALUE and not just the syntax. (b) **`gen_fk33_card.py`'s own comment contains the string `"--generic", "NAME=VALUE"`**, so scraping the generator yields a phantom generic `NAME`: 23 names against the artifact's 22. The haystack-contains-the-needle trap, third variety after `pgrep -f` and the log that embeds its own script, and one more reason the artifact is the right thing to read -- a VHDL generic map has no commentary in it.
- **GATES.** `--only kvmap` **`OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`**, `--only fk33card` **`PASS 1 FAIL 0`**, `--only stale` **`PASS 2 FAIL 0`**, all `--jobs 1`, every `OVERALL` line read and non-zero. `check_kv_map.py` -> **41 rows, 0 refused, 0 not run**; `--teeth` -> **44 of 44**. **Control: every pre-existing row printed the identical number before and after the rewrite** (diff of old vs new output modulo the row-name change and the new row), which is what shows the artifact and the generator agree at HEAD.
- **THE CHECKER IS SCHEDULED, IN TWO PLACES** -- worth saying beside TRACK MUTWIRE's "0 of 63 mutation harnesses are reachable from any `regress.sh` row": `sim/regress.sh:2873` `[kvmap]=` and `sim/realshape_gate.sh:386` as `kv_map_manifest_link`. **`--teeth` is NOT a gate row**; row text handed over below rather than applied, because `sim/regress.sh` has an owner tonight.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **`--teeth` is unscheduled.** For the owner of `sim/regress.sh`: `[kvmapteeth]="python3 $REPO/tools/check_kv_map.py --teeth"` beside `[kvmap]` at `:2873`, a `printf 'kvmapteeth\tsim\tRUN...'` line beside `:2097`, and the name in the `run_selfcheck` case list at `:2977`. It needs both manifests, so it is a NOT-RUN-if-absent row. (b) **No build has ever been shown to run under a trim**: `grep -rn 'FK33_C_KV_BLOCK\|FK33_A_ROWS_IF'` over `*.sh`, `*.py`, `*.tcl` finds **no setter anywhere in the tree**, the committed artifact is at 32/48 and its stamp says `(unset)` for both. The split was **latent, not active**, and no shipped bitstream is implicated -- what is NOT established is what any historical build's shell held. (c) **`A_ROWS_IF` still has no authority anywhere**, so its value is unchecked except by `sim:fk33card`'s byte comparison; `gen_fk33_card.py`'s `LEGAL` table deliberately records none and a fabricated bound would be worse. (d) **`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` is the same class and was not touched** -- generated, ungated, its generator rewrites the repo file even on `--help`, and nothing reads its generic values to compare them against anything. (e) **The NUMERICAL consequence of a `C_KV_BLOCK` change was not measured**: the address map is invariant across the legal set and the RTL is internally consistent at each member, but no oracle was run on the logits, and the BFP block-exponent granularity genuinely differs. The claim is about the map, not the values. (f) **`check_kv_map.py` still reads `sim/realshape_gate.sh` by regex** for the KVR values; nobody has asked whether a `-g` the row does not actually pass would be noticed.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK POPPORT: **the 27-port RENDEZVOUS is SOUND at the card's arm** -- values unchanged, the 24-way AND costs nothing, and **eight of seventeen mutations are caught by the new cadence probe and by nothing else**

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/tb_weight_streamer.vhd` (EXTENDED, not replaced -- no new gate row), `sim/mutate_ws_fastpop.sh` (new, a `.sh` so still no gate row), a new dated section 20-29 appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-shape-a-bench-runs-at.md` (SHAPEAUDIT's file, extended in place as POPCOVER did), this entry. **NOTHING IN `rtl/` TOUCHED** -- `weight_streamer.vhd` `4cf69b248cce7d7bdc719c03a0fcf510`, `axi_rd_port.vhd` `5ce9d4f2136fb1c61f617698fd7f3f03`, `async_fifo.vhd` `72dd8ff7d3e4830c0352ddd3f63ba48b`, `stream_fifo.vhd` `349a4ea8e77011c89c35dd2698ee0a98`, identical at both ends. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends of every window). `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd` (`30902816d2920a7bdff131dfe7e3ec16`), `rtl/attn_block.vhd`, `tools/check_model_shape.py`, `rtl/compose4_top.vhd`, `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh`, any `gen_*.py`, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK ELABCLASS). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/popport`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE ANSWER: THE COMPOSITION IS SOUND. Build 11b is not implicated by anything here.** MEASURED at the card's exact shape (`ROWS_IF=48 / AXI_DW=256` -> 24 weight + 3 scale = **27 masters**, `DUAL_CLK=true` so the per-port FIFO is `async_fifo` with the real CDC, `FAST_POP=true`): every word and every scale group is bit-exact against the two independent encodings of spec 6.5a, under random per-port AXI stalls and random consumer back-pressure, exactly as at `FAST_POP=false`.
- **AND THE 24-WAY RENDEZVOUS COSTS NOTHING, which is the thing a per-port result cannot say.** MEASURED: 21 accepts span **20 core cycles** at true and **30** at false; 20 is EXACTLY one word per cycle over the 20 gaps and 30 is EXACTLY POPCOVER's 1.5 core cycles per beat. A 24-way AND of ports that are individually two-cycles-in-three could have been far worse than 1.5 if they drifted out of phase; they do not. The 3-way SCALE rendezvous, which pops on `s_take` and not on `pop_w`, follows at **20** fast and **29** slow. **No scatter at all** -- the dual-clock and single-clock branches gave identical numbers on every arm.
- **THE LEVEL IS `weight_streamer`, NOT `tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual`, and the reason is structural.** That bench is at the right geometry and the right `DUAL_CLK`, but it is a value oracle end to end and **a value oracle can only prove the lever harmless, never present** -- `FAST_POP` changes no value by construction. Its consumer is `matvec_core`, which cannot be shut and then opened flat out, so a cadence measured there is a property of the array's acceptance pattern. `weight_streamer` is the SMALLEST entity whose cone holds all three of the per-port FIFO, the fan-out to all 27 ports (`:207` and `:228`) and the rendezvous itself (`all_v` at `:252`, `s_allv` at `:284`) -- and it already had a bench at geometry A, so extending it adds no row.
- **BOTH `axi_rd_port` FORWARDING SITES ARE PROBED.** `:276` into `stream_fifo` and `:397` into `async_fifo` are NOT textually identical (the second also carries `OUT_MARGIN`), so a generic dropped from one is invisible at the other's `DUAL_CLK`. Rows T3 and T4 are exactly that defect, one each, and each is seen only at its own branch.
- **THE CADENCE ORACLE IS TWO-SIDED**, POPCOVER's shape lifted directly: phase 1 shuts the consumer and stocks all 27 FIFOs, phase 2 opens it flat out and times the drain, so the window holds the read-issue condition and the rendezvous and NOTHING else -- no AXI latency, no slave stall, no AR throttle. The fast instance fails if it is slow AND the slow instance fails if it is fast. The R-beat census that gates phase 1 runs in the **AXI domain**, because sampling it on `clk` would miss or double-count beats at 1.67x and open the window on a FIFO that was not stocked.
- **TEETH: 17 rows, `sim/mutate_ws_fastpop.sh`, with a STANDING TWO-LAYER ATTRIBUTION CONTROL on every row.** Each mutation runs against THREE benches: **OLD** (the newest committed revision without POPPORT's extension), **NOCAD** (the new bench with the four cadence bounds neutralised -- the card's arm instantiated, nothing timed) and **NEW**. Result: **rows 17, pre-existing 4, card-arm 3, CADENCE 8, SURVIVED 2**, 1 m 44 s.
- **WHAT THE CONTROL COST, which is the whole reason to run it.** Fifteen rows fail the NEW bench. Four (R1-R4) were already caught by the pre-POPPORT bench and the probe is worth NOTHING on them; three (P1, P6, S1) are caught by merely INSTANTIATING the card's arm, with no timing involved. **Without the NOCAD column "eight cadence kills" would have been written as fifteen.** The OLD control is found by walking back for a marker string, never `HEAD~`: a fixed offset makes OLD equal to NEW the day this commit lands, and every cadence row would then read "pre-existing" -- the control failing open.
- **THE TWO ROWS THAT JUSTIFY THE DESIGN.** **T6, the lever WIRED ON**: every arm reads 20/20, every value correct, and a one-sided "is the fast arm fast" check passes it cleanly -- only `SLOW_MIN` sees it. **T2, `gen_s` loses the lever**: the weight side reads a perfect 20 and only the scale side's 29 gives it away, which is what timing the two rendezvous SEPARATELY buys. **P3** (POPCOVER's, the fast arm committing one) reads **40/39** -- SLOWER than the shipping arm it exists to beat -- with zero value errors anywhere.
- **SURVIVORS UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES, one PROOF and one scoped GAP.** **S3** makes the SHIPPING arm slower; the bench MEASURED it at `dual slow 60/58`, printed it and deliberately did not fail, because the check asks "is the shipping arm FAST", never "is it exactly 1.5" -- **a check that killed S3 would be asserting a cadence nobody has argued for**. **S2** (`OUT_MARGIN + 1` in the g_dc branch only) is a real GAP and is left alone on purpose: this bench is never capacity-bound (24 beats into a 64-deep FIFO), making it so would change what it measures, and the instrument for that defect already exists and already runs both arms -- POPCOVER's `minslack` in `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`.
- **THE GATE-ROW HAZARD WAS WEIGHED AND NO `tb_*.vhd` WAS ADDED.** `ws_check` gained `DUAL`, `FASTP`, `PROBE` and `PN` generics plus an `aclk` port, all defaulted so the two original instances are bit-identical; six new instances at geometry A. The dual-clock arm cost **five lines**, because every clock reference in the AXI slave already went through one `tick` procedure -- no `sclk <= aclk when DUAL else clk` anywhere, that costs a delta and a delta-skewed clock is what silently broke `sim/tb_matvec_int4_ip`. **MEASURED runtime: 0.267 s -> 1.601 s**, `+1.33 s` on one row, which `regress.sh` reports as `0s -> 1s`.
- **GATES, with md5 windows matched at both ends.** `--only tb_weight_streamer --jobs 1` -> **`OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0  REGRESSION: PASS`**. Neighbours: `--only tb_axi_rd_port` -> `OVERALL PASS 3 FAIL 0` (`tb_axi_rd_port`, `tb_axi_rd_port_dual`, `tb_axi_rd_port_stray`). `--only mutate_ws_fastpop` -> `OVERALL PASS 0`, which is what a pattern matching nothing looks like and is the proof the new harness is not a row.
- **MEMORY.** `free -g` before every run, beside build 11b: **14 GiB available** and swap 13-14 of 31 throughout. The largest thing this track ran is one `ghdl-mcode` bench at **1.6 s**; the whole 17-row harness is 1 m 44 s. No Vivado, no full gate, `--jobs 1`, targeted `--only` only.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **The DESCRIPTOR port's `FAST_POP` is outside this bench's cone entirely** -- `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd` forwards the lever at `:628` and `:690` and only one of those is `weight_streamer`. (b) **`sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual` still runs `FAST_POP` at its default of false**, unchanged by this track; SHAPEAUDIT's cell D is MEASURED evidence that it PASSES at `FAST_POP=true`, but that was a manual run, so the full descriptor plane at the card's arm is **demonstrated and not gated**, and closing it costs a new wrapper entity and therefore a new ~50 s row that somebody should decide on rather than a track absorbing quietly. (c) **The real consumer is not modelled** -- the probe's is flat out, `matvec_core`'s is not; the claim is "the rendezvous CAN deliver one word per cycle", never "subsystem A will". (d) No AR-throttle or capacity-bound behaviour is reachable here, by construction -- see survivor S2. (e) **The 27 ports were never made to starve**: the probe stocks every FIFO equally and the value arms stall them at random, and no case deliberately holds one port empty while the other 26 are full. The rendezvous is a pure AND so this is believed safe, and "believed" is the right word. (f) **Nothing here is a silicon measurement.**

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GATERED: **both red rows are green** -- `sim:shapechk` was red because of one English word in a comment, `sim:c4stale` was a real staleness, and the old teeth row that should have caught the first one was built from the same misconception as the check

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/check_model_shape.py` (commit `51ace89`), `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` (regenerated, commit `e64cc67`), `sim/mutate_rmsnorm_rs_mem.sh` and `sim/mutate_rmsnorm_bf_mem.sh` (commit `c269d35`), this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at the start, middle and end of every window; three other tracks were gating and bash re-seeks a running script by byte offset). **`rtl/attn_block.vhd` NOT edited** (md5 `c18be311192b7d30922e12ac4169834b` at both ends), deliberately, see below. `sim/mutation_harness_*.tsv`, `sim/regress_mutwire_rows.patch`, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`, `sim/ooc_levercost*`, `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`, `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK HDRCOST). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/gatered`, never `/tmp`.
- **ROW 1, `sim:shapechk`: `OVERALL PASS 0 FAIL 1` -> `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`.** `generic_defaults()` found the entity with `\bentity\s+NAME\s+is\b(.*?)\bend\b` over RAW source and stripped comments one stage LATER, at the generic clause. `56d13e3` wrote `-- end: SCORE_EARLY moves the pass earlier` inside `attn_block`'s generic clause; the non-greedy body terminated on that English word, the clause never closed, and the row failed with "no generic clause" over a design that is correct. Found by TRACK MUTWIRE.
- **THE FIX WENT IN THE CHECKER AND NOT IN THE COMMENT, and the comment is deliberately still there.** `end` is a legal English word and the next author is entitled to write it; editing it clears the row today and leaves the trap armed for whoever writes "end" next. Leaving it standing makes the committed tree a live regression case for the change. The fix is not an invention either: the two sibling parsers using this **identical** regex, `tools/check_beh_ports.py:63` and `tools/rtl_map.py:31`, already stripped comments before matching and were immune.
- **TEETH, and T2/T3/T8 are the load-bearing rows**, run in a detached worktree under `/mnt/storage` so the live tree was never mutated, every case restored from a pristine copy. T0 CONTROL pre-fix checker on the committed tree `rc=1` (reproduces the red); T1 hardened, committed tree `rc=0`; **T2 generic clause GENUINELY absent `rc=1`; T3 entity GENUINELY absent `rc=1`; T8 the same for `gdn_block`, the second file parsed, `rc=1`** -- those three are the proof a false RED was not traded for a false GREEN, which is strictly worse; T4 the original M1 (`HEAD_DIM 256 -> 128`) still `rc=1`; T5 a wrong literal hiding behind an `-- end:` comment still `rc=1`; T6 the old M6 control does not bite; T7 a comment-only `-- end end end end.` does not bite. 13 literals checked in every passing case, the same count as before.
- **AND THE OLD CONTROL COULD NEVER HAVE FOUND THIS.** M6 existed to confirm "comments are stripped before parsing" and it confirmed a strip that ran one stage too late, using a comment that happened not to contain the word the regex was about to trip over. Attribution control, with the `end:` comment elided so the pre-fix checker can reach a verdict at all: baseline PRE-FIX `rc=0` / HARDENED `rc=0`; plus the T7 comment PRE-FIX `rc=1` / HARDENED `rc=0`. **T7 discriminates the two checkers and M6 does not.** Check and control were wrong in the same direction: the recorded "a teeth test whose mutant is built from the same misconception as the check cannot detect that misconception", in a new place. M6 is kept as T6 because it still fixes scope.
- **NO FIFTH INSTANCE IS FIRING, AND TWO ARE LATENT.** MEASURED over every entity-header regex in `tools/`, `sim/` and `hw/`: `tools/gen_bd_wrapper.py:189` and `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py:584` both span to `\bport\s*\(` over RAW source, so a comment containing "port (" truncates them the same way -- **0 such comments in scope today**, so both are latent rather than broken, and are recorded in `check_model_shape.py` rather than changed under this track. `sim/mk_browse_wrapper.py:41` is safe **by accident**: its `^end\b` is line-anchored and a comment line starts with `--`. `gen_pcieep.py` and `check_bd_ports.py` are line-anchored by design. **No debugging document was written**, because the brief conditioned one on finding a fifth FIRING instance and there is none.
- **ROW 2, `sim:c4stale`: `OVERALL PASS 0 FAIL 1` -> `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`.** A real staleness. `56d13e3` added `dbg_sw_ph` and `dbg_sw_aux` to `attn_block` and did not regenerate the composed top. Fixed by `python3 hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py` with no flags, which is the mode whose output is committed, **not** by hand. **The diff was read, not trusted:** 6 insertions and 2 deletions in one file -- the two entity ports, the two instance connections, and the header banner's `c_attn attn_block 68 ports, 66 exported -> 70 ports, 68 exported`, which is derived from the two additions and not a second edit. Nothing else moved. This is the second time this file has gone stale; the first (`11bf64b`) surfaced by luck, and this one was caught by the row, which is the argument for the row.
- **NOTHING ELSE REDDENED.** The consumers of `compose4_top.vhd` and of the shape literals were run: `shapemirror` `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`, `bdports` `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`, `cardtop` `OVERALL PASS 3 FAIL 0`.
- **THIRD ITEM: `xwswap` WAS THE IDENTITY, and it is retired rather than re-anchored.** TRACK MUTWIRE reported it surviving at every geometry in both `sim/mutate_rmsnorm_rs_mem.sh` and `sim/mutate_rmsnorm_bf_mem.sh`; it was declared UNKNOWN so it never affected rc, but it sat in the **denominator** of any kill ratio read from those tables. **DERIVED from the RTL rather than inferred from the survival**, because "survives at every geometry" is also exactly what a real fault the bench cannot see looks like and the two have opposite remedies: `x_q, w_q : s16a` are both `signed(15 downto 0)`, `resize(x_q*inv32, 48)` is a no-op on a 48-bit product, `resize(w_q, 17)` widens, and the 65-bit product truncates to the same 64 bits either way. Multiplication commutes, so the mutant is **bit-identical to the baseline**. It is not a fault the bench tolerates; it is not a fault, so it could not be re-anchored, only removed.
- **REPLACED, NOT WEAKENED, by `xwhalf` at the SAME SITE:** only one of the two lines substituted, so the stage computes `w*inv*w` for `x*inv*w`. A full swap of two commuting operands is no fault at all; the **half** swap is the copy-paste slip that site is actually exposed to, and it is a **harder** target than the retired row because it must be caught on values -- the opposite of the recorded failure of re-anchoring a row by making its mutant trivial. Declared `BITE` rather than `UNKNOWN`, so the harness's own exit code is the teeth test. MEASURED, both harnesses to completion, `rc=0` and 0 failures each: `xwhalf FULL rc=1 noVAL rc=1 noVL+LT rc=0 BITE` in both. **The attribution is not flattering by accident:** the kill is earned by the value checks, it survives with both value checks off, and that is correct for a value fault. No structural check is credited with it. Denominators now honest: rs_mem 10 rows, 8 BITE / 2 SURVIVES; bf_mem 14 rows, 11 BITE / 3 SURVIVES, every survivor a deliberate resolution-floor row under its own name. `sim/check_mutation_harness.py` after the edit: `checked 63 harnesses; 0 finding(s)`, rc 0. Neither harness is a scheduled gate row, so nothing in the gate moves.
- **MEMORY.** `free -g` before every run, beside build 11b: available **14-15 GB** throughout, free 10 GB at the start and 2-3 GB at the end with 12 GB in cache. Largest thing this track ran is one `ghdl-mcode` bench at **1.75 s**; each mutation harness is ~35 `ghdl` runs at that cost. No Vivado, no full gate, `--jobs 1`, targeted `--only` only.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) The two **latent** comment-eating regexes above are recorded and NOT fixed: `gen_bd_wrapper.py:189` and `ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py:584` are one "port (" in a comment away from the same failure, and nothing gates either. (b) Whether `56d13e3` left anything ELSE stale is not established -- `c4stale` covers `compose4_top.vhd` only, and **`hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py` remains ungated** because it takes no arguments, writes unconditionally, and rewrites the repo file even on `--help`. (c) The `shapechk` row still does not cover subsystem A (descriptor-driven, no literal to compare) and at `NCARDS = 1` a per-card-versus-total confusion stays invisible; both were already stated in the file and neither moved. (d) `owe_norst` and `transpose_all` survive in BOTH rmsnorm harnesses and `align_rnd` in `bf_mem`; they are correctly reported under their own names and **were not investigated here** -- whether each is a genuine no-op or a resolution gap is unanswered. (e) No full gate was run, so this track establishes only that the two named rows are green and that four neighbours did not move; the rest of the board's colour is not measured from here.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK POPCOVER: **the `FAST_POP` arm the card ships is SOUND** -- build 11b is not at risk; and the bench it was invisible to let **nine of ten** read-issue mutations through

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd` (extended, not replaced -- no new gate row), `sim/mutate_async_fifo.sh` (row O1's dead anchor repaired, new self-teeth row Z0, new class POP of 15 rows with a standing attribution control, an exit contract), a new dated section 10-19 appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-shape-a-bench-runs-at.md` (TRACK SHAPEAUDIT's file, extended in place rather than forked), this entry. **`rtl/async_fifo.vhd` NOT touched** (md5 `72dd8ff7d3e4830c0352ddd3f63ba48b` at both ends). **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends of every gate window; three tracks were gating and bash re-seeks a running script by byte offset). `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`, `sim/ooc_levercost*`, `sim/mutation_harness_*.tsv`, `sim/check_mutation_harness.py` and `docs/LEVERBOARD.md` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware** -- the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on TRACK HDRCOST). Scratch on `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/popcover`, never `/tmp`.
- **THE ANSWER TO THE TIME-CRITICAL QUESTION IS: LOAD IT. `FAST_POP = true` IS SOUND.** MEASURED on a first run, with **zero** RTL changes: with the arm instantiated at all eight clock ratios, every property the bench has passes exactly as at false -- the value-and-order oracle, `w_level >= occupancy`, occupancy within `DEPTH + OUT_MARGIN`, no beat accepted during a clear, the four-phase clear with residue resident, write-only / read-only / skewed reset recovery, the drain accounting, and both coverage asserts. Two numbers carry it: **`maxocc` is 18/16 in BOTH arms**, so the fast arm reaches the same `DEPTH + 2` capacity and no more; and **`minslack` is 0 in both arms with zero `w_level UNDER-STATES` reports**, so the AR throttle's one safety guarantee still holds with exactly zero slack under the faster cadence. That was the thing that could have broken, because `OUT_MARGIN` and its `+1` were DERIVED against the shipping arm's condition.
- **AND THE LEVER MEASURABLY WORKS.** DERIVED from the two conditions and MEASURED with **no scatter at all** on all seven ratios at `DEPTH >= 16`: the shipping arm takes **15** read cycles to deliver 10 beats, the `FAST_POP` arm takes **10**. 1.5x, which is the silicon slope (1.5101 core cycles per weight word) reproduced in simulation. A constant, not a mean and not a fit.
- **THE HOLE WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN ONE MUTATION AT ONE SITE.** SHAPEAUDIT's 2x2 showed one planted defect surviving five benches. Fifteen mutations were planted here; **eleven survived the bench at `92ba3ec`, and restricted to the read-issue logic proper it is NINE OF TEN** (the one exception, P8, is not arm-specific). After this track nine of those ten are caught and the tenth is a provable no-op.
- **THE VALUE ORACLE CAN ONLY PROVE THE LEVER HARMLESS, NEVER PRESENT**, because `FAST_POP` changes no value by construction. So a second oracle was needed: `cadence_probe` stocks the FIFO, STOPS the writer, opens the reader flat out and times the drain from the first beat consumed, so the window contains nothing but the read side's own issue condition -- no write clock, no clock ratio, no stimulus density. It is **TWO-SIDED**: the fast arm fails if it is slow AND the slow arm fails if it is fast.
- **THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL IS STANDING, NOT A ONE-OFF, AND IT COST THE NEW CHECK ONE ROW.** Every class-`POP` row runs twice, the second time with `-gCADENCE=false` (both arms, every pre-existing property, the cadence check removed), and the harness prints the credit on its own line. The cadence check is credited with **three** rows and not four: P3 dies in the control column too, under the pre-existing `max_occ < DEPTH + 2` coverage assert. The three it does earn are **P4 the lever INVERTED, P5 the lever NOT THREADED, P6 the lever WIRED ON** -- pure wiring defects that change no value in either arm, and on which every other oracle in the file, the arm instantiation included, reports **0 errors**. P5 is what a generic dropped anywhere between `fk33_engine` and `async_fifo` looks like.
- **A SECOND DEFECT, NOT ABOUT `FAST_POP`: THE CLEAR WAS ONLY EVER ENTERED WITH NOTHING IN FLIGHT.** Row P11 leaves `mem_q_v` set across the read side's park, so a read still in flight when the clear arrives strands a stale beat. It **survived both arms** -- because phase 4 stocks the FIFO with the reader STOPPED, the output stage saturates, `do_rd` has been low for many cycles at the park, and nothing is ever in flight across it. The only clear the bench had was the one shape in which P11 is inert. `PHASE 5b` now runs both sides flat out INTO the clear; P11 is killed in both arms, at 7 of 8 fast ratios and 3 of 8 slow. **Under `FAST_POP` a read is in flight on essentially every read cycle, so that is the card's normal state.**
- **ROW O1'S ANCHOR HAD BEEN DEAD SINCE THE COMMIT THAT ADDED THE LEVER, killed by the same edit.** Its text `and (ocnt + inflight) < 2 else '0';` stopped existing when `do_rd` became a disjunction. It printed `ANCHOR FAILED -- tested nothing` from that commit on -- honest, and still a row measuring nothing; TRACK MUTWIRE recorded it as `DEADROWS O1` the same day, independently. Repaired, and **the new anchor is scoped in CODE** (the `(not FAST_POP)` guard is inside the matched text), so it cannot silently start matching the other arm. Its FAST_POP twin is P2.
- **TEETH ON MY OWN MACHINERY, BOTH DIRECTIONS**, run in a scratch copy, never in the repo: honest run `Z0 BADMUT ... 37 of 49 ... exit 0`; **Z0 given a REAL anchor -> `Z0 SURVIVED` + `HARNESS FAILURE: row Z0 was run and did NOT report BADMUT`, exit 1**; a real row (O5) given an impossible anchor -> `O5 BADMUT` + `HARNESS FAILURE: 1 anchor(s) matched zero times`, exit 1.
- **SURVIVORS REPORTED UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES, AND BOTH ARE PROOFS RATHER THAN GAPS.** **P10** (`do_rd` drops its `clr_r_s2 = '0'` term) survives correctly: `do_rd` is read ONLY inside `rproc`'s ELSE branch, the branch `clr_r_s2 = '1'` takes over, so the term is redundant by construction -- same shape as the existing F5. **P14** (the memory read gated on `do_rd` instead of issued every cycle) survives correctly: `mem_q` is consumed only under `mem_q_v`, which is `do_rd` one cycle late. Do not add checks for either; a check that killed them would be wrong.
- **CORRECTION TO A CLAIM IN `sim/tb_async_fifo.vhd`, and it predates this track.** The coverage comment said the `DEPTH + 2` bound resolves mutations F3 and G6. **For F3 it does not.** MEASURED at `92ba3ec` in an unmodified `git archive` tree: `ONLY=F3` reports `1 SURVIVED` with `maxocc=18/16`. DERIVED: `full_r` is REGISTERED and computed from `used_w(n)`, so moving its threshold to `DEPTH-1` without moving the look-ahead arm still admits the write at `used_w = DEPTH-2`, and the memory still reaches `DEPTH`. **F3 costs no capacity, which is why nothing sees it.** Corrected in place, not deleted.
- **THE GATE-ROW HAZARD WAS WEIGHED AND NO FILE WAS ADDED.** A new `sim/tb_*.vhd` becomes a row for every track on every run; the eight ratios were factored into one `af_ratios` block and instantiated twice instead. MEASURED cost: `PASS sim:tb_async_fifo 1s` against 0 s before; honest end time 76.03 us -> **83.44 us**, still 24x inside the row's `--stop-time=2ms`. **`sim/regress.sh`'s recorded `76.03 us` is now stale by that amount** and was deliberately left alone; no action is needed, but whoever next edits that file should refresh the comment.
- **GATES, with md5 windows, all matched at both ends.** `--only tb_async_fifo --jobs 1` -> **`OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`**; `--only async` -> `PASS sim:tb_async_fifo 1s`, `OVERALL PASS 1`; `--only gray` -> `PASS sim:graygate`, `OVERALL PASS 1`. The other consumer of this bench, `sim/mutate_gray.sh`, is **byte-identical before and after**: `rows=12 NEW CHECK ALONE=1 both=4 old bench only=0 NEITHER=4 shape gate=2 VOID=1` at HEAD and at the change. Harness totals `37 of 49 (27 KILLED + 10 ABORT), 11 SURVIVED`, 29 s, exit 0; before this track, 33 rows with O1 dead.
- **MEMORY.** `free -g` before every run: 15-17 GB available throughout, never below 10 GB free, beside build 11b. Largest thing this track ran is a single `ghdl-mcode` row at **0.44 s**; the whole 49-row harness is 29 s. No Vivado, no full gate, `--jobs 1`, targeted `--only` only.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (a) **This is the FIFO in isolation** -- it says nothing about `axi_rd_port`, `weight_streamer` or `matvec_int4_desc_axi` against the faster cadence, and nothing about the 27-port composition where the array accepts a word only when all 27 ports present a beat in the same cycle; `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual` is the only A bench at `DUAL_CLK = true` and **it still runs `FAST_POP` at its default of false**, which is the obvious next item and is a different file. (b) Whether `FAST_POP` has ALREADY cost anything on silicon is still unanswered and cannot be answered from here -- what IS established is that a silicon discrepancy, if one appears, is not in this FIFO's read-issue logic. (c) `HOST_WINDOW` is still uncovered and POSW=17 is still run by no harness, both from SHAPEAUDIT section 9, untouched. (d) The `tiny` ratio (DEPTH 4) is a VALUE row in both arms and a **cadence row in neither**: at 6 resident beats the two arms are 3 cycles against 4.5 and that gap is inside the probe's start-up jitter. (e) The cadence thresholds are calibrated on seven points that all gave the identical `(10, 15)`; an `OUT_MARGIN` or output-stage change would move them, and the check would then fail loudly rather than silently.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK BUILDREPORT: the reports were never missing, they were never KEPT -- Vivado has written a placed utilization and a routed timing summary on every build this flow has ever run, and nothing copied them out

- **Files owned and changed:** `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh`, this entry. Commit `952e70a`. **`hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` NOT committed** (see the trap below). No RTL, no bench, `sim/regress.sh` NOT opened. **No hardware. NO VIVADO ANYWHERE** -- both lanes were busy and build 11b was in placement throughout. Scratch under `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/buildreport/`.
- **THE ANSWER, AND IT REFRAMES THE BRIEF.** MEASURED from `impl_1/bd_wrapper.tcl` of the running build 11b: Vivado's own run strategy already emits `bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt`, `bd_wrapper_timing_summary_routed.rpt`, `route_status`, `control_sets`, `io`, `power`, `methodology`, `drc` and `clock_utilization`. **The placed utilization report LEVERBOARD needed has existed on every build; it was never copied anywhere, and `BUILD_ROOT` is reused.** Build 10's four files in the repo are there because a human copied them by hand. The genuinely missing report is the only one nobody asked Vivado for: **`-hierarchical`**.
- **AND IT IS MEANINGFUL ON THIS FLOW, WHICH WAS NOT OBVIOUS.** MEASURED, `FK33_CARD FLATTEN_HIERARCHY = none` in build 11b's `build.log`. Module boundaries survive synthesis, so a hierarchical table is a real attribution. Under Vivado's default `rebuilt` the optimiser crosses every boundary and rebuilds the hierarchy afterwards, and the same one line would have produced an approximation dressed as a measurement.
- **WHAT LANDED.** (1) A **post-place hook** (`STEPS.PLACE_DESIGN.TCL.POST`) writing `bd_wrapper_utilization_placed_hier.rpt` inside the run right after `place_design` -- a hook rather than a line after `open_run` because **a build that fails in route never reaches `open_run`, and that is exactly the build that needs an area table**; build 10 is that build. (2) A **routed** hierarchical report after `open_run` (`fk33_pcieep_util_hier.rpt`), needing no hook, as the fallback if the hook does not arm. **Do not subtract one from the other**: post-route phys_opt remaps cells and the parts do not sum across contexts. (3) A **harvest** into `hw/fk33/results/build_<tag>_<stamp>/`, created before Vivado starts, outside `BUILD_ROOT`, written by the hook (the moment place finishes) and by an **EXIT trap** (fires on success, failure and Ctrl-C), carrying `PROVENANCE.txt` with the git HEAD, the dirty count and every `FK33_*` variable, plus the line-anchored `^FK33_` sentinels, the phase times and the intermediate timing blocks. Anything over 512 KB is gzipped: the routed timing summary is **7,491,472 bytes** on this design (MEASURED, `card_swg_2026-09-20` committed it uncompressed).
- **MARGINAL COST: ESTIMATE, seconds.** The only instrumented `report_utilization` figure in this repository is **7 s elapsed** on a placed composed design (`hw/fk33/results/timing_2026-08-30/squeeze_stdout.txt:527`), and the closest measured size anchor is `compose4_top`'s own hierarchical report at **28,192 bytes / 192 lines** (`util_hier_c4_synth.rpt`; `wire4`'s routed one is 31,402). Against an impl whose `report_methodology` alone costs **2 m 22 s** (MEASURED, build 10) this is noise. **NOT measured on `bd_wrapper` itself**, whose XDMA and HBM IP add hierarchy the composed top does not have; the harvest gzips it either way.
- **VALIDATED WITHOUT VIVADO, and this was most of the work.** `gen_pcieep.py --selftest` **PASS in both configurations** including its `PARSE` row (`info complete` over the whole emitted script): `FK33_CARD=0` PASSED in the repo, `FK33_CARD=1` PASSED in an isolated `git ls-files` copy of the tree, `FK33_ENG=0` PASSED and keeps the routed report in the configuration-independent tail. The **arming block was extracted and EXECUTED** under stub `set_property`/`get_property`/`get_runs`: A1 armed, A2 (`set_property` throws) said `HOOK NOT ARMED` and exited 0, A3 (accepts but does not apply) said `HOOK NOT ARMED`. **ATTRIBUTION CONTROL on A3: the same state with the readback check DELETED reports "hook armed"** -- the readback earns its own kill. The **hook file it writes is valid Tcl** and was **EXECUTED in four states** under a stub `report_utilization` (dir present -> copies three files; `FK33_REPORT_DIR` unset; pointing at a file; `report_utilization` throwing), all four exit 0. The **harvest function was extracted and EXECUTED** against a fake build tree: full tree (11 files, the 900 KB report gzipped, the anchored grep excluding the echoed `# puts` source line); **a build exiting 7 (harvested AND the status stayed 7)**; an empty `BUILD_ROOT` (exit 0, and the "no placed hierarchical utilization" warning FIRED here and not in the control); an unwritable destination (exit 0, the build is not failed).
- **NOT VALIDATED, stated plainly: NO VIVADO RAN.** Whether `STEPS.PLACE_DESIGN.TCL.POST` is accepted by a Vivado Implementation run, and whether `report_utilization -hierarchical` succeeds on a placed `bd_wrapper`, are **both UNTESTED**. That is precisely why every path is inside a `catch` and why `FK33_HIERUTIL` distinguishes armed from not armed rather than being silent. `pcieep_build.sh --bd-only` would exercise the arming block for 3 minutes and **was not run, because it starts Vivado.**
- **HOW IT WAS ESTABLISHED SAFE TO EDIT A FILE A RUNNING BUILD READS.** Not by looking at a command line. MEASURED from `/proc/<pid>/fd`: the bash interpreting `pcieep_build.sh` for build 11b (pid 386811) holds its fd on **`/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/wt11/hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh`**, a detached worktree at `5dc3ee5`, **inode 40392652** against this tree's **21892858**. Different file, so no byte shifted under its interpreter. The two Vivados were identified the same way, by `/proc/<pid>/exe`, never by `pgrep -f`.
- **BUILD 11b IS NOT AFFECTED AND NEEDS A MANUAL COPY.** It runs the pre-change script, so it will produce no placed hierarchical table. **Its placed utilization report -- LEVERBOARD section 8 item 1, the first measurement of whether removing 19,344 flip-flops frees CLBs -- will appear at `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build11b/root/fk33_pcieep/fk33_pcieep.runs/impl_1/bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt` and must be copied into the repo before the next build reuses that tree.** Same for `bd_wrapper_timing_summary_routed.rpt` (gzip it, 7.5 MB).
- **MEASUREMENT TRAP HIT, MY OWN, AND IT COST A FILE.** `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` is GENERATED and its committed form was produced with env this track could not reconstruct (`FK33_CARD=1` **plus** `FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed` **plus** a 75 MHz `CLKOUT3`). I regenerated it with the default environment to validate, which silently **changed its configuration** -- 497 deletions including the whole lever-C block -- and the working tree already carried an uncommitted regeneration from 18:42 that I had then overwritten twice. Restored with `git checkout --` to the committed card-configured form. Nothing is lost (the build regenerates it at line 53 of `pcieep_build.sh`), but **"regenerate and diff the output" is not safe when the generator reads the ENVIRONMENT**: line 2 warns you the file is generated and says nothing about which of six variables produced the copy in front of you. **Regenerate in a scratch copy of the tree, never in the shared checkout.**
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** Whether `STEPS.PLACE_DESIGN.TCL.POST` is a valid run property in Vivado 2023.2 for this flow (the catch makes a wrong answer harmless, not detected in advance). The hierarchical report's actual size and runtime on `bd_wrapper`. Whether the hook's `puts` reaches `build.log` -- impl-run output does stream there (`report_power: Time` appears in build 10's `build.stdout`), but the sentinel has never been seen. Whether an interrupted build mid-`route_design` loses everything after place: **the trap covers the script exiting, not the tree being deleted under a live Vivado, which is what happened on 2026-09-20**; a background poller would close that and was deliberately NOT built, because build 9's tree was destroyed AFTER it finished, so the trap would have saved it. Whether a report directory per build is the right granularity once builds are frequent. And the three committed `hw/fk33/results/card_*` directories still disagree on file naming (`utilization_placed.rpt` against `bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt`), which this change does not unify.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK HDRCOST: `SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` **does not synthesise** -- the brief's area-and-timing question had no netlist to measure; `SCORE_EARLY` costs **+5 LUT and +2 FF**; the fixed tree costs **+512 LUT and +136 FF for the same 0.06 cycles**

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` (**one functional line**: the fold loop bound `0 to NBLK-1` -> `0 to TW-1`, plus its comment), new `sim/ooc_scorehdr.tcl`, `sim/ooc_scorehdr_pnr.tcl`, `sim/ooc_scorehdr_run.sh`, `sim/ooc_scorehdr_run2.sh`, new `hw/fk33/results/hdrcost_2026-09-20/`, `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-header-tree-does-not-synthesise.md`, this entry. **`rtl/attn_block.vhd` and `rtl/llama_top.vhd` NOT touched.** No hardware; the card was live and serving throughout. **No Vivado on the workstation**; all five arms on the BC-250 under `MemoryHigh=11G`, never raised.
- **THE ANSWER TO THE BRIEF'S QUESTION IS "NEITHER", AND IT IS NOT AN AREA RESULT.** MEASURED, 49 s into the first Vivado ever run on the generic: `ERROR: [Synth 8-11324] array index 8 out of range [rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd:488]`, then `8-285` on `attn_score_q12` and on `attn_block`, at `HDR_TREE = 1`, `NBLK = 8`, the card's own geometry. `Parameter HDR_TREE bound to: 1` is in the same log, so this is the lever failing and not the harness ignoring it. **There was no netlist, so there was never an area or a timing number to weigh.**
- **BUILD 11 KEEPS `SCORE_EARLY`, AND IT IS THE FIRST MEASURED NUMBER EITHER C LEVER HAS EVER HAD: +5 CLB LUT sites and +2 flip-flops** on an 86,891-LUT block, with LUT-as-memory, CARRY8, F7, F8, block RAM, RAMB36/18, URAM and DSP48E2 all **exactly 0**. The +2 FF confirms TRACK MIDGAP's DERIVED "2 flip-flops plus control" to the flip-flop.
- **THE DEFECT IS ONE LOOP BOUND, AND NO BENCH IN THIS REPOSITORY COULD HAVE SEEN IT.** Line 488 is the odd-level carry `wv(i) := wv(2*i)` with `i` running to `NBLK-1 = 7`, so the unrolled loop statically reads `wv(8)..wv(14)` of a `0 to 7` array. It is unreachable at run time (`if i < nn`, `nn <= 4`), **so GHDL never evaluates the index and Vivado always does.** The sibling branch at `:475-478` survives because Vivado folds its `2*i + 1 <= wn - 1` guard against `wn`'s subtype; the else branch carries no relation between `i` and the bound at all. **The lever had passed a 20-point bit-exact grid, two independent C oracles, a 23-row mutation suite with attribution controls, and five green gate groups while being unsynthesisable.** None of those is a bad test; every one answers a different question. This is CLAUDE.md's recorded *"neither error is reachable by any bench"* rule moving from block-design ports down to plain RTL, where **nothing schedules the cheap discriminator** -- one OOC `synth_design` per generic arm, 49 s in this case to find it.
- **AND IT INVERTS SCOREHDR'S OWN ARGUMENT IN PLACE.** Its comment on the failing branch says it is *"UNREACHABLE at any power-of-two NBLK"* and *"exercised by running this unit at NBLK = 5 and 7 rather than argued to be correct."* Both halves are true and together they are the trap: unreachability at `NBLK = 8` is exactly why simulation there cannot see the index, and `NBLK = 5`/7 exercises the branch's VALUES, not its ELABORATION.
- **THE FIX: `for i in 0 to TW-1`, where `TW = (NBLK+1)/2` is already a constant in the file.** It is the EXACT bound, not a conservative one -- the first fold has `wn = NBLK` so `nn = ceil(NBLK/2) = TW`, and every removed iteration was already a no-op. **MEASURED simulation-identical: 20 of 20 points of SCOREHDR's own grid (`NBLK` 3/5/6/7/8 x `HDR_TREE` 0/1/2/3), stdout compared byte for byte against `HEAD`'s file**, with the golden regenerated from `ref/attn_score_q12_vec.c` and `cmp`-identical to `HEAD:sim/attn_score_q12_vec.txt`.
- **TEETH, WITH THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL, because a green grid across a change means the change is untested.** Mutant M1, the same bound one too small (`0 to TW-2`): **KILLED 11 of 15**, and **KILLED at `HDR_TREE = 1` at all five `NBLK`**, which is the level that ships. Both attribution controls at `HDR_TREE = 0` (where the loop is unreachable) **SURVIVE**, so the kills belong to the tree path. **The four survivors are reported under their own name and they are a gap in the VECTORS:** at `HDR_TREE >= 2` with `NBLK` 7 or 8 the committed 64-case set never puts the global minimum in the top pair, so it cannot resolve a lost top-pair entry at two or more folds per cycle. Gate after the fix: `tb_attn_score_q12` PASS 1, `tb_attn` PASS 16 / NOCHECK 1 / SKIPPED 4, `tb_csweep_rate` PASS 1, `cardtop` PASS 3 with `GEN_CARDTOP_CHECK: OK`, FAIL 0 everywhere.
- **THE FIXED TREE, MEASURED, AND IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE RECOMMENDATION.** Same tree except that one line (113 of 114 `rtl/*.vhd` blobs `cmp`-identical), same flow, same generics: **+512 CLB LUT sites, +136 flip-flops, +12 CARRY8, -32 MUXF7, 0 BRAM, 0 DSP**; routed **CLB 20,519 against base's 20,377** and **routed WNS 3.101 against base's 3.101, identical to three decimals**, 0 failing endpoints of 250,542, fully routed with 0 routing errors. Its own deepest new path -- `gen_head[0].u_sq/tl0_reg/C` -> `e_min_reg[1]/D`, the register-mux-compare-mux-register chain SCOREHDR predicted -- routes at **5 logic levels with 10.292 ns of slack, 7.19 ns more margin than the block's critical path.**
- **SCOREHDR'S ESTIMATE WAS RIGHT TO THE FLIP-FLOP AND ITS CONCLUSION WAS WRONG.** Estimated +136 FF per `attn_block`, measured **+136**; estimated +32 FF of `tv` per unit, and the `score_tv` cone is **128 cells = 32 x 4**. Estimated +520 to +800 LUT, measured **+512 sites / +772 cells**. But its conclusion was *"they are interchangeable, and this is the smaller change"* -- **cycle-equivalent yes (231.11 against 231.17), and 102x apart in LUT and 68x in flip-flops.** "Smaller change" was true of the source diff and false of the device, and nothing in a cycle measurement could tell them apart. **On a card bound by CLB occupancy at 99.81%, 0.06 cycles does not buy 507 LUT.** The fix is still worth landing because a released generic that kills `synth_design` is a trap for whoever tries it next, and because the tree becomes the right answer if `SCORE_EARLY` ever has to come out.
- **THE CONTROL, AND IT IS EXACT.** `SCORE_HDR_TREE` has exactly ONE functional occurrence in `rtl/attn_block.vhd` (`:1123`, into `u_sq`'s generic map), so nothing outside `gen_head[*].u_sq` may move. MEASURED: block LUT cells **+772** and cone LUT cells **+772**; block FD\* **+136** and cone FD\* **+136**; block CARRY8 +12 and cone +12; block MUXF7 -32 and cone -32. **Every added and every removed cell is inside the cone.** And the negative control: `early`'s cone census is **byte-identical to `base`'s on every REF_NAME** (5,404 cells, 3,460 LUT, 1,780 FD\*, 92 CARRY8, 56 MUXF7), which is what makes the cone census admissible as evidence about a generic inside it.
- **THE HEADLINE WNS COULD NEVER HAVE ANSWERED THIS, AND THE NUMBER IS ZERO.** `SCOREHDR_CONESHARE top=200 in_score_cone=0` in **all three routed arms**, including the one that adds 772 LUT cells and 136 flip-flops to that cone. The cone's own worst path carries **~6.3 ns more slack** than the block's critical path. LEVERCOST recorded this post-synthesis; it is now confirmed post-route.
- **AND THE NOISE FLOOR OF THIS HARNESS IS ABOUT 0.4 ns, MEASURED FOR FREE.** `base` and `early` differ by **+5 LUT and +2 FF** and their routed WNS differs by **0.366 ns**, on different critical paths in different modules (`u_arr`'s DSP feed against `u_quant` -> `vs2_q`). A 5-LUT change cannot move a path in the quantiser, so **that 0.366 ns is placement-and-routing variance and no WNS difference below roughly 0.4 ns in this flow is a result.** It also means `treefix`'s 0.000 ns is "did not move by more than the noise", not "provably did not move".
- **CAUTION FOR LEVERBOARD'S `+69 LUT / +25 FF` FOR THE C PAIR:** it sums LEVERCOST's `SWEEP_PIPE` +64 (tree `bc4156f`, clock created AFTER `synth_design`) with this track's `SCORE_EARLY` +5 (tree `cc5f92f`, clock read BEFORE it). **MEASURED, the uncontrolled term is bigger than one of the addends:** LEVERCOST's `cswp_on` and this track's `base` are the SAME configuration and read **86,724 against 86,891, a 167 LUT gap** -- 2.6x the +64 being quoted. Each pair is sound within its own harness; the SUM is not a same-tree measurement and should not carry the MEASURED label. The order of magnitude is not in doubt and the decision does not turn on it.
- **MEASUREMENT TRAPS HIT, INCLUDING MY OWN, all four in `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-header-tree-does-not-synthesise.md` section 10.** (1) **My reporting code killed a completed 1,416-second route** on `[Common 17-54] ... does not have a property 'LOGIC_DELAY'`, an hour after I wrapped every `get_timing_paths` in a catch -- **the call that failed was `get_property`, which the wrapper did not cover.** Guarding the call that has already failed says nothing about the call that has not; the route survived only because `write_checkpoint` runs before the reporting section, so re-reporting cost 121 s instead of 24 minutes. (2) **My own sentinel counter matched my own script**: `grep -c 'Synth 8-10226'` returned **1** in every arm, and the single match is the tcl's own `foreach mid {{Synth 8-7186} {Synth 8-10226}}` line echoed into the log. True count 0 -- the unanchored-grep trap in a fourth place, and it invents a warning rather than hiding one. (3) **`report_route_status` prints no "unrouted nets" line when the design is fully routed**, so a regex for it returns NA and a completeness check built on it is vacuous; the informative rows are `fully routed` against `routable` plus `routing errors`. (4) **`remove_clock` is not a command in Vivado 2023.2** -- the catch reported `invalid command name` in every pnr run, and the consequence is benign only because phase 1 had created the same clock on the same port at the same period.
- **MEMORY, AND WHICH FIGURES ARE HONEST.** All three synthesis arms **hit the 11G cap** (`base` 11,266 MB resident with **7,064 MB** of swap beside it, `early` 11,267/6,680, `treefix` 11,267/6,858), so **none of those peaks is an appetite**; DERIVED true footprint at least ~18 GB, actual peak UNKNOWN. **The place-and-route arms did NOT reach the cap and those figures ARE appetites: 6,794 / 6,807 / 6,809 MB with ZERO swap.** Routing this block costs 40% of what synthesising it costs, which is the opposite of the intuition that set the cap. Cap never raised: 12G on that 14 GB box once left it unreachable and it is on no WoL watchdog.
- **SYNC:** 114 `rtl/*.vhd` blobs from `git show HEAD:<path>` at **`cc5f92f`** into a standalone remote root (`/home/labuser/hdrcost`), manifest sha256 **verified identical on both boxes** before launch (`d88f8e7...`); the one-line-fix tree separately as `/home/labuser/hdrcost_fix` (`baa1173...`), with every one of its 114 blobs `cmp`-checked against the pristine tree so the arm is provably one-variable. GSRWIDE's in-flight `rtl/llama_top.vhd` edits did not travel. A mid-run hardening of `sim/ooc_scorehdr_pnr.tcl` was re-synced ALONE and `run_hdrcost.sh` was deliberately NOT re-sent, because bash was executing it and bash reads a script by byte offset.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED:** **whether the fixed tree fits the CARD is unanswerable OOC** -- the card's +0.061 ns is congestion at 99.81% CLB under a spreading strategy and this block routes at 37% CLB fill; whether `SCORE_HDR_TREE` at **2 or 3** synthesises (same loop, same bound, so the fix should cover them -- not measured, no arm drawn); the four M1 survivors, i.e. the committed vector set cannot resolve a lost top-pair entry at `HDR_TREE >= 2`; **whether any OTHER generic in this repository has the same elaboration-only failure mode** (nothing enumerates the class and nothing schedules the 49-second discriminator); `early`'s **-101 routed CLB** against base, almost certainly the same placement variance as the 0.366 ns but not controlled for; and that only `tb_attn_score_q12` was run against the fix over the full 20-point grid -- the block- and rate-level benches were run once each, not gridded.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK MUTWIRE: **NOT ONE of the 63 mutation harnesses is wired to a gate row, one has been dead since the commit that created it, and a 30-second sweep found fifteen more dead rows that three tracks missed**

- **Files owned and changed:** new `sim/mutation_harness_wiring.tsv`, new `sim/regress_mutwire_rows.patch`, a new section 9 appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_why-mutation-anchors-die.md`, this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (md5 `91f5619ad8796867bf6e23c077906992` at both ends; two other tracks were running gates). **No `sim/mutate_*.sh` edited**, including `sim/mutate_gain.sh` (GAINTEETH's) and `sim/mutate_rmswire.sh`. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`, `rtl/attn_block.vhd` NOT touched.** No hardware. **No Vivado anywhere.** One temporary one-word edit inside a disposable detached `git worktree` on `/mnt/storage`, reverted in the same command, never in the shared checkout.
- **THE ANSWER: SCHEDULED 0, UNSCHEDULED 63, UNCERTAIN 0.** MEASURED three ways: `regress.sh --list` gives **218 rows, 0 matching `mutate`**; the dispatcher is a closed set of four paths (`run_one` -> `$GHDL`, `run_graygate` -> `sim/gray_check.sh`, `run_seam` -> `tools/ref9b/seamgate.sh`, `run_selfcheck` -> 21 fixed commands) and `grep -c mutate_` over all 23 of those commands finds three hits, **all comments**; and an `execve` trace of one row of each kind shows **0 mutate execs while the SAME graygate trace shows 25 execs of `sim/gray_check.sh`**. The last is the discrimination test; the first two are a grep.
- **THE FALSE NEGATIVE THAT AGREED WITH ME.** The FIRST execve trace reported `gray_check` 0 AND `mutate` 0 -- a clean confirmation, and wrong: `strace` truncates argv strings at 32 characters and the repo path is longer, so the word `gray_check.sh` never appeared. Only the POSITIVE control caught it. **A control that can only fail in the direction you are hoping for is not a control.**
- **`sim/mutate_mv4i_desc_stale.sh` HAS NEVER RUN.** MEASURED: `rc 2`, zero rows, at HEAD **and in a detached worktree at `3ecc729`, the commit that ADDED it on 2026-08-30**. Its M2 anchors on `if go = '1' then go_p <= '1'; end if;` and `3ecc729` itself had already made that line `if go_now = '1' then go_p <= '1'; done_l <= '0'; end if;`. **`sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` classifies it correctly**, because MUTAUDIT audited the MECHANISM and never invoked the thing. A true statement about how a harness would report a failure is not a statement that it runs.
- **FIFTEEN MORE DEAD ROWS, from a 30 s sweep of all 63** (Z0 self-teeth excluded): `gdn_block` M01-M05, `gdn_scalar` B2-B5, `attn_kv_axi` B3/P1/P2, `async_fifo` O1, `seq_tbl_shape` N1, `matvec_core` D3. **Every one of those harnesses exits 0 or times out**, so nothing says so. `attn_kv_axi`'s three died at `6c9aa09` (2026-08-29), the commit that fixed the 4.5 GB `to_integer` bug they guard, by replacing `to_integer(x) mod N` with `low_bits(x, k)` -- section 4.4's `fk33_seam` M9 shape in a second place. **32 of 63 did not finish in 30 s, so fifteen is a FLOOR, not a count.**
- **AND MOST OF THESE MUST NOT BECOME GATE ROWS. 47 of 63 have NO exit code at all** -- the last executable statement of 49 of them is an `echo`, so the script exits 0 whatever it printed. Of the 15 that do exit non-zero, **8 report only a dead ANCHOR, never a lost property**. Six have a verdict exit and one of those six is another track's untracked file. So "wire it" is, for most, "write an exit contract, teeth-test it, then wire it".
- **RECOMMENDED: THREE ROWS, +102.3 s MEASURED (+2.1% on the recorded 82m09s full gate).** `sim:mutaudit` (`check_mutation_harness.py`, **0.02 s**), `sim:mutrms` (`mutate_rmsnorm_rs_mem.sh`, **56.3 s / 18.3 MB**) and `sim:mutbfm` (**46.0 s / 18.2 MB**) -- the only two harnesses of 63 with a verdict exit, under 60 s, under 100 MB, over shipping RTL. Exact lines in `sim/regress_mutwire_rows.patch`, to be applied in ONE atomic edit when no gate is live. `BASELINE_PASS` deliberately untouched: the last full run was RED.
- **`sim:mutaudit` STILL must not be wired, and it is now red HERE and green on a clean tree AT THE SAME COMMIT.** MEASURED: shared checkout `FAIL R1: sim/mutate_gain.sh is not in sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv`, rc 1; detached worktree at the same `9435942`, `checked 62 harnesses; 0 finding(s)`, rc 0. R1 lists harnesses with `os.listdir`, so any track's untracked harness reddens the row for everybody. **Third consecutive track to decline the fix because the file belongs to a live track**, which is itself the finding. **CORRECTION, same evening: GAINTEETH landed `sim/mutate_gain.sh` and its manifest row in `1632012` while this track ran, so the precondition is now SATISFIED** -- MEASURED in a fresh worktree at `634cc29`: `63` harnesses, `checked 63 harnesses; 0 finding(s)`, rc 0, 0.02 s. All three rows may be applied together. The `os.listdir` defect is untouched, so the next track to start a harness reddens the row again.
- **TWO COMMITTED GATE ROWS ARE RED AT HEAD, in a clean worktree, and one of them for a single word in a comment.** `sim:c4stale` is a true staleness (`56d13e3` added `dbg_sw_ph`/`dbg_sw_aux` to `attn_block`; `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` was not regenerated -- **C's owner**). **`sim:shapechk` is not**: `check_model_shape.py` finds the entity with `\bentity\s+attn_block\s+is\b(.*?)\bend\b`, and `56d13e3` put a comment reading `-- end: SCORE_EARLY moves the pass earlier` INSIDE the generic clause, so the body is truncated before the clause closes. MEASURED both ways in the worktree, changing that ONE WORD and no code: `SHAPE_FAIL` -> `SHAPE_OK 13 literals agree with model_cfg_pkg` -> `SHAPE_FAIL` on restore. **The design is correct and the row is red.** Fix is to strip `--` comments before the entity search, which the same function already does one line later. NOT done here: not this track's file, and the RTL is a live track's.
- **A ROW THAT IS THE IDENTITY AT EVERY GEOMETRY**, the CBANCHOR K10a class one notch worse: `xwswap` in both `mutate_rmsnorm_rs_mem.sh` and `mutate_rmsnorm_bf_mem.sh` swaps x and w across two pipeline registers whose product is taken in the next stage, and both are `signed(15 downto 0)`, so it computes `w*inv*x` for `x*inv*w`. Identity by commutativity, unkillable, **correctly declared UNKNOWN so it does not touch the exit code** -- but it is in the denominator of any kill ratio read off the table (7 pinned of 10, and 10 of 14).
- **`mutate_a_geom.sh` peaks at 2.24 GB in 13 seconds**, against `CLAUDE.md`'s 2.13 GiB for the FULL both-suite gate and CBANCHOR's 175 MB for a targeted run. Both of those remain true and **neither bounds an arbitrary harness**. And `mutate_swiglu_mem.sh` is **495.8 s** for the same contract that costs `mutate_rmsnorm_bf_mem.sh` **46.0 s**: do not infer a harness's runtime from its shape.
- **`free -g` at dispatch: 0 free, 24 GB swap, 3-4 GB available**; it rose to 18 GB mid-track and fell back to 4. Peak of anything this track ran: **2.24 GB, once, for 13 s**. Nothing was run concurrently with anything else.
- **NEXT, branched.** (a) If GAINTEETH commits and audits `sim/mutate_gain.sh`, apply the patch's `sim:mutaudit` row and verify `--only mutaudit` gives `OVERALL PASS 1`. (b) If not, the class fix is R1 reading `git ls-files` and reporting an untracked harness as a note; that is a change to MUTAUDIT's checker and needs its own teeth in both directions. (c) The fifteen dead rows want owners: `attn_kv_axi`'s three are a mechanical `to_integer(x) mod N` -> `low_bits(x, k)` substitution, `mv4i_desc_stale` needs re-expressing against a line that exists. (d) **The high-value follow-on is a generic anchor-liveness gate row over all 63**, which would have caught every finding in this document; it is NOT a patch hunk, because REANCHOR's stubbed replay works by sed-ing each harness's own row function and that function is called `run_case`, `run_row`, `row`, `run_cap` or `mrow` depending on the harness.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK LEVERBOARD: seven levers, one board -- `docs/LEVERBOARD.md`, and the binding constraint is not what the FF arithmetic suggested

- **Files owned and changed:** new `docs/LEVERBOARD.md`, this entry. **NOTHING ELSE.** No RTL, no generator, no bench, no harness. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited**; `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd`, `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` and every `sim/mutate_*` NOT opened for writing. **No hardware. No Vivado, no GHDL anywhere** -- this track ran nothing; every figure was read back from its source file, its commit or its results directory. Scratch under `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/leverboard/`.
- **WHAT BUILD 11b IS ACTUALLY BUILDING, MEASURED from the build's own source, not from a brief.** `build.stdout:162` reads its RTL from `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/wt11`, and that worktree is at **`5dc3ee5`**, clean on `rtl/`: `FAST_POP_DEFAULT = True`, `CB_RANKS` present (17 hits), **`SWEEP_PIPE` ZERO hits in both `rtl/llama_top.vhd` and `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`**, and `SWG_WIDE` not declared there at all. Build launched 19:00:59; `9cdf13b` landed 19:01:30 and `a95017c` 19:49:14. **Build 11b is FAST_POP + the per-row codebook and nothing else.**
- **THE CODEBOOK'S -19,344 FF DOES NOT CREATE CLB HEADROOM, and that contradicts the premise it was going to be planned against.** DERIVED from the placed report: FF is **35.14%** occupied and **5.63 of 16 per occupied CLB**, so FF was never the binding row and freeing 2.20% of it frees nothing on the capacity axis. Bounds on CLBs actually freed: **upper 1,209** (19,344/16, if every one sat in an FF-only CLB), **lower 0** (if each sat beside the LUTs of the copy it serves, which is what a `dont_touch` replica looks like). **The value is UNKNOWN and only a placed report answers it** -- build 11b's, and it is item 1 of the board's read-list. What the fix relieves is ROUTING: fanout 1,536 -> 48 with `CB_WR_LAT` unchanged, a factor of 32 on the input and zero measurements of the output.
- **THE CLIFF IS BETWEEN 512 AND 7,688 LUT, DERIVED.** At the placed density of **6.6193 LUT per occupied CLB** the 106 free CLBs absorb **702 LUTs**. So `FAST_POP` (+1), `SCORE_EARLY` (+5), `SWEEP_PIPE` (+64) and even the FIXED header tree (+512) are placement noise; `B_RECUR_LANES=16` (+7,688) needs **1,161 CLBs' worth of space against 106 free** and can only land by raising average density to 6.7593, against a placer running `Congestion_SpreadLogic_high` whose purpose is to spread. The free-LUT split reproduces LEVERCOST's to the digit (75,737 inside occupied CLBs + 848 in the free ones = 76,585).
- **BUILD 10's AREA STORY IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TREE, and the control that would settle it does not exist.** MEASURED from the only two placed reports in the repository: against `card_swg` (Sep 20 01:14), build 10 (14:39) placed **CLB -103, CLB LUTs -1,734, LUT-as-Logic -1,537, FF -768**, and larger only in BRAM (+28). **Build 9's placed report is absent** -- `card_kvreg_2026-09-20/` has `build.stdout`, `timing.txt` and profiles, and `grep -c 'CLB LUTs' build.stdout` = **0** -- so the pair that would test "the levers grew the card block" has never been made, and the pair that exists points the other way. Not a refutation; a missing control, flagged. The 1,536-sink fanout is measured either way, so `0b34200` stands regardless.
- **GSRWIDE's CHEAPEST-SETTLING PLAN IS A JOB LEVERCOST PROVED CANNOT RUN.** Section 4.5 of the SwiGLU write-up asks for "one OOC synthesis of `fk33_llama_top`" at four `(SWG_LANES, SWG_WIDE)` points. That is the **same entity** `hw/fk33/ooc_c_in_card.tcl` records `grep -c 'Finished RTL Elaboration'` = **ZERO** for across **twelve attempts on two machines**, best case 47 h wanting 39.1 GiB. Both landed the same day and neither knew about the other. The runnable substitute that closes the disputed cone is `swiglu_mem` alone at LANES 1/2/4/8, because GSRWIDE's own attribution is that "the lane replication is the entire area question" and the muxes are +32 LUT.
- **THE SLOPE/INTERCEPT SPLIT IS THE WHOLE DECISION, AND A SINGLE tok/s FIGURE HIDES IT.** From the MEASURED `30,115,217 + 2,793.4*p`: the intercept levers (FAST_POP, SwiGLU, B_RECUR, A_DRAIN_WIDE) are worth +9 to +28% and that SHRINKS with context; the C levers are worth **0% at p=0 and +40.6% at p=32,768** and that GROWS. DERIVED tok/s for six compositions at five positions is in the board. **Across-opcode additivity is structural** (the profiler's opcode table is a partition summing to the intercept exactly, so a saving in `A_JOB` and one in `VEC_SWG` cannot overlap) -- that sharpens LEVERCOST's "assumed, not measured" rather than repeating it. **Within `A_JOB` it is still assumed**: FAST_POP and A_DRAIN_WIDE are both in there and the pair has never been run.
- **RECOMMENDED FOR BUILD 12, and deliberately not everything at once.** **(1) C only** -- `SWEEP_PIPE` + `SCORE_EARLY`, already at HEAD, **+69 LUT and +25 FF MEASURED**, 0.09% of the free LUT sites, slope 2,793.4 -> 1,801.4, **+14.8% at p=2,048 and +40.6% at p=32,768**, risk LOW. **(2) plus `SWG_WIDE=true` at `SWG_LANES=1`** -- one `--generic`, 393,280 cycles for two muxes and no lane replication, area ESTIMATE only and the write-up gives two different FF figures for it (160 and 365). **(3) `B_RECUR_LANES=16` ALONE, as a separate build** -- the largest single intercept lever (2,362,128 cycles, +21.6% at p=0) and the only one whose failure mode is a build that does not close, at 10.04% of the free in-CLB LUT sites. Excluded from all three: `SCORE_HDR_TREE` (does not synthesise as committed, and beside `SCORE_EARLY` it buys 231.11 against 231.17, i.e. nothing), `SWG_LANES=8` (area unknown to a factor of 2), `A_DRAIN_WIDE` (no harness that exists can price it, and it collides with `SWG_WIDE` on `wgmux`).
- **EIGHT PLACES WHERE THIS TRACK REFUSED TO PROJECT**, each named in section 6 with its reason: `SWG_LANES=8`'s area from `SWG_LANES=1`'s; any fit over a `SWG_LANES` area series that does not exist; the ratio-vs-absolute bench-to-card slope conversion (both shown, the conservative one used, the 0.9-1.1% spread left open); `-19,344 FF` into freed CLBs; summing the C levers (SCORE_EARLY + HDR_TREE is 64.00 measured against 76.00 summed); FAST_POP + A_DRAIN_WIDE additivity; any WNS for the codebook fix; and repairing build 10's area story rather than flagging it.
- **A RISK THAT IS NOT AREA: build 11b's one lever is unbenched.** TRACK SHAPEAUDIT landed mid-write and its finding is folded in -- `grep -rn FAST_POP sim/` hits five Vivado scripts and **no `.vhd`**, so a green gate says nothing about the arm the card builds. Cheapest open item on the board, because the discriminating bench already exists.
- **OPEN, 12 items, in section 7.** The first two gate a decision: HDRCOST's `treefix` ROUTED arm is still running (its AREA has landed at **+512 LUT sites / +136 FF, every added cell inside `u_sq`**, and `arms/pnr_treefix.csv` does not exist yet), and **the one-line fix is not in the repository** -- `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` still reads `for i in 0 to NBLK-1` at the fold, so `SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` remains a setting that kills `synth_design` in 49 s with nothing in the gate able to see it. Also open: no per-subsystem card area figure exists at all (`report_utilization` is written without `-hierarchical`, a one-line fix that makes every future comparison same-tree); whether `SWG_WIDE` and `A_DRAIN_WIDE` elaborate together at all; and whether the `lane0` slice constant-folds.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK SHAPEAUDIT: **`FAST_POP` is shipped by the card and named in ZERO benches** -- a planted defect in its arm passes `tb_async_fifo`, the unit's own testbench, and fails instantly at the card's value

- **Files owned and changed:** new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-shape-a-bench-runs-at.md`, this entry. **NOTHING ELSE.** No RTL, no bench, no harness. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited**; `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (ATTNWIRE), `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` and `sim/ooc_levercost*` (HDRCOST) NOT opened. No hardware. **No Vivado anywhere** (workstation on build 11b, BC-250 on HDRCOST). Every GHDL run was in an ISOLATED `git archive HEAD` tree under `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/shapeaudit/`, never the shared tree; `git status --porcelain` on the two mutated RTL files was EMPTY at the end.
- **THE CARD'S CONFIGURATION, read from `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd:222-243` and not from any document.** 22 generics: `A_DESC/B_STATE_AXI/B_SRC_REAL/B_CONST_HBM/C_KV_AXI/C_REAL/NORM_REAL/SWG_REAL/SMP_EN` all **true**, `HOST_WINDOW` **false**, `C_N_ROT=64, C_KV_BLOCK=32, C_KV_ADDR_W=33, C_MAXPOS=C_CTXLEN=65536, WDOG_LIMIT=4000000, A_ROWS_IF=48, A_JOB_STRIDE=0x40000`, both 9B image paths. **Everything else takes `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`'s default, and those defaults are the SIM-SCALED values** -- `C_KV_BLOCK` defaults to 4, which `gen_fk33_card.py`'s own `LEGAL` table calls ILLEGAL at `C_KV_AXI=true`. The engine cell is a separate job (`gen_fk33_engine.py:79-99`, `ROWS_IF=48`, `FAST_POP_DEFAULT=True`, `DUAL_CLK=true`). Model shape is a PACKAGE CONSTANT (`rtl/model_cfg_pkg.vhd:85`), so no bench can get it wrong.
- **THE DEMONSTRATED CASE, a 2x2 with both attribution controls.** `grep -rn FAST_POP sim/` hits five Vivado area/timing scripts and **no `.vhd` at all**. Card is `FAST_POP => true` (`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd:139`); every RTL default is false. Planting `after_e < 2` -> `< 4` in the **`FAST_POP` arm only** of `rtl/async_fifo.vhd:382`, on `tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual` (the only A bench at the card's `DUAL_CLK=true`, so the FIFO under test is the card's):

  ```
                     FAST_POP=false (every bench)   FAST_POP=true (the card)
    baseline         PASS 1                         PASS 1      <- control
    mutant  <4       PASS 1   <- the no-op          FAIL 1      <- bound check, async_fifo.vhd:431
  ```

  The baseline/card-arm cell is what makes it mean anything: the bench CAN run the card's arm and passes there, it just never does. **The no-op widened, mutant still in place: `tb_axi_rd_port_dual`, `tb_axi_rd_port_stray`, `tb_async_fifo`, `tb_mv4i_desc_image` all PASS 1.** `tb_async_fifo` is the line that matters -- the dedicated bench for the very file carrying the defect does not see it.
- **THE SECOND FINDING IS THE SHAPE OF THE COVERAGE, NOT ONE HOLE.** The three `tb_llama_top_*` benches on the card's `C_KV_AXI=true` arm (`_seq`, `_bstate_seq`, `_kvport`) ALL run `NORM_REAL=false` and `SWG_REAL=false`; every bench with the real norm or real SwiGLU runs C's KV path in the behavioural arm. **`tb_llama_top_real`, whose gate comment says "EVERY computing unit real", runs `C_KV_AXI=false` and does not instantiate `rtl/attn_kv_axi.vhd` at all** (sole instance `rtl/llama_top.vhd:6875`, inside `gkvaxi : if C_KV_AXI generate` at :6750). No bench sets `KV_AXI` together with `NORM_REAL`, or with `SWG_REAL`. `SWG_REAL` landed 2026-09-19 and the card ships it. The gate is a set of single-lever draws around a baseline and the card is at none of the draws.
- **MOST DIFFERENCES ARE BENIGN AND SAYING SO IS HALF THE RESULT.** `tb_swiglu_mem_9b` (`N=12288, LANES=1, WIDE_IO=false`), `tb_attn_twiddle` (`NPAIR=32`), `tb_csweep_rate` (`HEAD_DIM=256, N_QH=16, N_KVH=4, KV_BLOCK=32, N_ROT=64`), `tb_l2norm_rs`, `tb_rmsnorm_bf`, `tb_gdn_head_emit`, `tb_gdn_scalar` are card-shaped. `sim/realshape_gate.sh` already elaborates the card KV geometry. A bench at `HEAD_DIM=16` for speed is correct engineering.
- **MEASURED AND REJECTED.** (1) *"The RoPE table above index 7 is dark"* -- `tb_attn_twiddle:53` defaults `NPAIR := 32` and its oracle recomputes from libm, so the unit bench covers what no integration bench can. (2) *"Mutate `attn_kv_axi` to show the `C_KV_AXI` no-op"* -- true but tautological, the module is not instantiated; a one-line grep, not two 300 s runs. `FAST_POP` was chosen BECAUSE it is a plain condition inside a process shared by both arms.
- **CORRECTION, to this track's own delegated sweep, recorded in place.** A subagent's headline was that `tb_gdn_state_store` (`PIPE/WIDE/NWIDE` false) is "the largest divergence in the whole audit", while listing `sim/tb_bmover_phases.vhd` under "could not determine cheaply -- I did not open it". I opened it: **`:73,74,80` are `PIPE := true, WIDE := true, NWIDE := true`**, `CONST_EN := true` at `:65`, composing `gdn_job_seq` + `gdn_state_store` at 9B *"exactly as `gen_st_tier` wires them"* and checking every loaded word back, i.e. an ORACLE. **The card's B mover arms ARE covered**; residual difference is `MAXOUT=4` against 8. Claim withdrawn, kept visible, because it is this audit committing the exact defect it is about: a coverage conclusion drawn from the files that were read, with the unread file named on the same page.
- **TRAP HIT, and it over-reported holes 2.5x.** A `set_true_sites=0` census flagged ten generics; **six were the bench entity using a DIFFERENT NAME** (`KV_AXI` for `C_KV_AXI`, `XEXP_PORT` for `USE_XEXP_PORT`, `A_DESC_G` for `A_DESC`). CLAUDE.md's `a_job_index` trap exactly. Every zero was followed up by reading the entity; only `FAST_POP` and `HOST_WINDOW` survived.
- **MEMORY.** `free -g` before each run, `--jobs 1`, targeted `--only` only, every `OVERALL` line read and non-zero. Box ranged 13 free / 16 available at start to 7 free / 12 available mid-run beside build 11b; the largest row here is the 302 s `tb_llama_top_seq` baseline. No full gate was run.
- **RECOMMENDED, NOT BUILT.** Cheapest durable fix is that a harness should PRINT its shape: one `report` line per bench naming the arm booleans it ran, so a reader of any log can see which arm produced the number. Costs one line per bench and no gate row. Second, `tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual` should gain a `FAST_POP=true` sibling the way `_dual` is a sibling of `_desc` -- that is the hole with a demonstrated defect behind it. **Deliberately NOT done here:** a new `sim/tb_*.vhd` becomes a gate row for every track whether intended or not, and three tracks are live.
- **OPEN, not determined:** whether `HOST_WINDOW`'s card arm is observable to any bench at all (`tb_llama_top` reads results through `hr_data`, which that arm zeroes) -- not established either way, not attempted. Whether the unverified `FAST_POP` arm has cost anything on silicon; it is ON in build 11b and this shows only that it is unverified, NOT that it is wrong. **POSW = 17 is run by no harness** (card `C_MAXPOS=65536`; benches 3 or 4, `ooc_attn_kv_axi` 16, `ooc_attn_kv_axi_card` 18) with no consequence established. **The whole `sim/*.tcl` table is DERIVED, not MEASURED** -- read from the scripts, nothing synthesised; `ooc_micro/ooc_pnr/ooc_micro_pnr/ooc_mover_paths/ooc_levercost` take top and generics from argv or env so their shape is not knowable from the file, and most quoted card leaf numbers came from `ooc_micro`. `sim/elab_cardtop.tcl` elaborates `fk33_llama_top` at ALL DEFAULTS (nine arms false, `HOST_WINDOW` true); whether any quoted number came from it was not traced. Cell B is one mutation at one site.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK ATTNWIRE: build 11's two attention levers now REACH THE CARD -- `SWEEP_PIPE` and `SCORE_EARLY` are ON in `llama_top`, and the regenerated card top carries both

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (one generic map, released to this track by GSRWIDE at `9cdf13b`), `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` (REGENERATED, not hand-edited), this entry. Landed at **`a95017c`**. **No hardware. No Vivado anywhere** (the workstation lane was on build 11b throughout, the BC-250 on TRACK HDRCOST). **`rtl/attn_block.vhd` NOT opened**, `sim/regress.sh` NOT edited (`91f5619a` at both ends), `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` and every `sim/mutate_*` NOT touched.
- **THE CHANGE, and it is one line plus its comment.** `u_attn : entity work.attn_block` now reads `NORM_LANES => 1, STRICT_PRODUCER => true, SWEEP_PIPE => true, SCORE_EARLY => true)`. Both generics default **false** at `rtl/attn_block.vhd:259` and `:285`, confirmed from the entity rather than from a brief, so every card build to date synthesised the OFF schedule. This is exactly the plumbing TRACK LEVERCOST said was missing (*"at HEAD the generic appears 24 times in `rtl/attn_block.vhd` and ZERO times in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`"*) and exactly the patch TRACK MIDGAP left as its NEXT item.
- **THE GENERATOR TRAP DID NOT BITE, and it was checked rather than assumed.** MEASURED: `tools/gen_cardtop.py --check` went **STALE** on the source edit and printed the expected hunk and nothing else; after `--bench` regeneration it is **OK**, and `grep` finds `SWEEP_PIPE => true, SCORE_EARLY => true` at **`rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd:7621`**. `sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd` was rewritten **byte-identically** (no diff). `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py --check` was **OK both before and after** and the extracted top contains **zero** occurrences of `attn_block`, so `sim:gdnstale` never had anything to carry. `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py --check` and `hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py --check` both **OK**.
- **THE CARD BUILD REACHES IT.** `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py:56` takes `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` as its `SRC` directly, and the generics are hardcoded in that file's **architecture body**, not on its entity, so LEVERCOST's `-generic`-cannot-reach-a-deep-instance hazard does not apply. MEASURED: `gen_fk33_card.py` mentions `attn_block` only in comments and performs **no substitution** over the generic map, so the edit cannot have broken it, and its `--check` agrees.
- **WHY THESE TWO AND NOT THE THIRD.** `SCORE_HDR_TREE` is deliberately **left at 0**. MEASURED by SCOREHDR/MIDGAP on `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd` at the real 9B geometry, cycles per position per C job: neither lever **355.17**, both **231.17**, and `SWEEP_PIPE` + `SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` is **231.11** -- indistinguishable, so the third lever buys nothing beside `SCORE_EARLY` while its area and routed timing are still being drawn by TRACK HDRCOST. `SWG_WIDE`, `SWG_LANES` and every other generic untouched.
- **GATE, five groups, FAIL 0 everywhere, `--jobs 1`, md5 window MATCHED at both ends** on `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (`f7da5e47`), `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` (`8f6f2420`) and `sim/regress.sh` (`91f5619a`): `cardtop` **PASS 3**, `gdnstale` **PASS 1**, `seamgate` **PASS 6**, `tb_attn` **PASS 16 / NOCHECK 1 / SKIPPED 4** (its standing shape, unchanged from MIDGAP's run), `tb_llama_top` **PASS 14**. Every `OVERALL` line read and every count non-zero, because a pattern matching nothing still prints `REGRESSION: PASS`.
- **MEMORY, since this ran beside a card build.** The box reached `free -g` **0 free, available 3, swap 27 of 31** during the `tb_llama_top` group. Attributed by `/proc/PID/exe`, not by `ps`: **Vivado 22.47 GB resident** against **209 MB** for this track's one `ghdl-mcode` and 139 MB for GAINTEETH's. That is the documented `FK33_CARD=1` profile, not a new emergency, and no GHDL lane was the marginal cause; it had recovered to 18 free / 9 swap by the end. Nothing was added while it was tight.
- **OPEN, not determined by this track:** the **AREA and TIMING cost of this change on the card is UNMEASURED here** -- `SWEEP_PIPE` is +64 LUT and exactly +23 FF at OOC level (LEVERCOST, on `attn_block` alone, and *"none of the top 200 paths is in the sweep FSM"* so its timing is a bound and not a measurement), and `SCORE_EARLY`'s cost is an **ESTIMATE** of two flip-flops plus control with no draw behind it at all. No gate row exercises `SWEEP_PIPE=true` or `SCORE_EARLY=true` **through `tb_attn_block`'s own default generics** -- the arms live in `sim/mutate_attn_sweep_pipe.sh` and `sim/mutate_attn_score_early.sh`, which **nothing schedules**; what the gate did cover is the composed path, `tb_llama_top*` and `tb_fk33_cardtop_ident` compiling and running the new setting. MIDGAP's four-combination bit-identity against two C oracles is **inherited, not re-derived**. And the DERIVED card figure (token slope 2,793.4 -> 1,818.1, +5.9% tok/s at 2,048) is MIDGAP's arithmetic and remains unconfirmed on silicon.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GAINTEETH: the norm-gain codebook has teeth for the first time -- **6 of 9 mutants bite, the structural gate sees ONE of them, and the landmark that catches the rest can be RE-PINNED over a wrong design**

- **Files owned and changed:** new `sim/mutate_gain.sh`, new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_codebook-teeth-and-the-repinned-landmark.md`, one inserted line of `sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` (my harness's row, nothing else), this entry. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` NOT touched** (GSRWIDE's; md5 `f7da5e47e5b4581978a53f45293f56be` at both ends). **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (`91f5619a` at both ends). **`rtl/matvec_core.vhd` NOT opened** (CBFANOUT/CBANCHOR's, and it is the OTHER codebook). **`sim/mutate_normw.sh` and `sim/mutate_rmswire.sh` NOT edited.** No hardware. **No Vivado anywhere.**
- **WHICH CODEBOOK, because there are two and testing the wrong one is the obvious failure.** This is the NORM GAIN store in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s `gvr` generate: `ixrom` (NW_N*NWORD x IXW, `rom_style = "block"`) plus `cbrom` (NCB x MANT_W, `"distributed"`), both ELABORATION-TIME constants built from the `NORM_W_IMAGE` generic, with **no ports at all**. Subsystem A's is `rtl/matvec_core.vhd`'s 16-entry IQ4_NL table, **runtime-loadable through `cb_we`/`cb_addr`/`cb_data`**, and it already had teeth. Told apart by PORT and FILE, never by the word.
- **REANCHOR's hole was real.** MEASURED: no `sim/mutate_*.sh` mutates `cbrom`, `CBMAP`, `CBMARK` or `ixrom`. Re-measured the image statistics from the images rather than quoting `c094867`: 9B `hw/fk33/gen/norm_w_9b.hex` md5 `69f614a1515e1160f5dc9e8a9e72fdc3`, **266,240 elements, 1,567 distinct, IXW 11**; the bench image is **576 / 406 / IXW 9**.
- **THE ORACLE IS `tools/norm_w_bisect.py`, AND IT IS NOT A ROUND TRIP.** Both halves come from outside the design -- the arithmetic from `ref/rmsnorm_bf_vec.c` via `vec_oracle.norm_bf`, the gain from the hex by its own reader -- and it compares `R_XN` bit for bit. Shown to discriminate on the gain in the same run: **9 of 9 seams match the model, 0 of 9 match the old synthetic ramp.**
- **THE TABLE (`da9a1aa`, control repeated green at HEAD `9cdf13b`), two runs per row -- an ABLATION, not a classification.** `struct` = `tb_llama_top` with the P14 landmarks UNSET; `land` = the same mutant with the gate row's landmarks pinned; `oracle` on the `struct` run's capture:

  ```
  G0  SURVIVES SURVIVES 9/9   control (ramp teeth: 0/9)
  Z0  BADMUT   BADMUT   BADMUT  impossible anchor      (REQUIRED)
  Z1  BADMUT   BADMUT   BADMUT  impossible SCOPE       (REQUIRED)
  G1  SURVIVES K:land   0/9   m7, UNPACKER HALF ONLY: cbrom's index reversed against CBMAP's
  G2  SURVIVES SURVIVES 9/9   m7, BOTH HALVES relabelled            DOES NOT BITE
  G3  SURVIVES SURVIVES 9/9   cb_mark walks the vector reversed     DOES NOT BITE
  G4  SURVIVES K:land   0/9   ixrom_flat packs the vector reversed
  G5  SURVIVES K:land   6/9   IXW one bit too narrow
  G6  SURVIVES SURVIVES 9/9   cb_count returns 2*NCB                DOES NOT BITE
  G7  K:struct K:land   0/9   cb_mark marks v mod 256
  G8  SURVIVES K:land   0/9   the lookup ignores wix
  G9  SURVIVES K:land   1/9   every norm op reads gain 0 (nidx ignored)
  G1R (G1)     SURVIVES 0/9   G1 with the landmarks RE-PINNED to its own output
  ```

- **G1R IS THE FINDING.** Take the m7 mutant, read the four landmark values it prints, pin THOSE -- which is exactly what would have happened had the codebook been wrong the day `c094867` landed -- and **`tb_llama_top RESULT: PASS` while the oracle still says 0 of 9**. A landmark says a design has not CHANGED; only the oracle says it was ever RIGHT. On this structure the oracle is not a redundant check, it is the only one.
- **THE STRUCTURAL GATE EARNS ONE KILL IN NINE AND IT IS INCIDENTAL.** With the landmarks unset, `tb_llama_top` PASSES over designs whose every norm output is wrong. The exception, G7, is caught by the **degenerate-residual** check (`residuals=14`, every other counter 0) noticing that the collapsed gain put the residual's operand exponents 19 apart -- not by anything that knows what a gain is. A smaller error of the same kind passes it.
- **THREE ROWS DO NOT BITE AND THEY ARE THE MOST USEFUL LINES.** G2, G3 and G6 are not merely PASSING, they are **bit-identical to the control (`R_X(0) = -16350 hash(R_X) = 90889`)**. G2 relabels BOTH halves of the codec: the labelling is private to the pair and has NO observable consequence, which is `c094867`'s single-source argument MEASURED rather than repeated -- and it is why a `decode(encode(v)) = v` self-test is mis-aimed here. G3's site looks exactly like the packing-order hazard and provably is not one (`cb_mark` builds a SET). **G6 doubles the codebook and is invisible to every simulation row in the project, because its cost is in BRAM tiles.**
- **G5 IS A PARTIAL KILL AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR A SEAM-RESOLUTION ORACLE.** One bit off `IXW` breaks exactly the three seams whose gain vectors use a codeword above 255 (`6/9`, with two showing an exponent change as well). A PASS/FAIL harness reports it identically to G7's nine-of-nine.
- **G9 CARRIES `sim/mutate_normw.sh`'s M3, WHICH HAS BEEN DEAD SINCE `47c9d9c`** (`wsel <= NW_TBL(nidx);` deleted by TRACK RMSWIRE; that harness reports BADMUT and exits 1). Re-anchored onto `wix <= ixrom(nidx*NWORD + ...)`, where `nidx` entered the gain path when `wsel` left it. Attribution is exact: **`EXP_X0` does NOT move** (norm op 0 legitimately reads gain 0) and the oracle matches seam 0 and nothing else. `sim/mutate_normw.sh` itself was deliberately NOT edited -- another owner's file, and the brief said write a new harness.
- **MY OWN Z0 SELF-TEETH ROW PASSED FOR THE WRONG REASON ON ITS FIRST RUN.** `local tag="$1" dir="$RUNDIR/${tag}_src"` -- bash declares both names local before evaluating either RHS, so `${tag}` was empty, `set -u` aborted `mut()`, **no mutant was ever written, and every row reported BADMUT including the one whose REQUIRED verdict is BADMUT.** A row whose expected output and broken output are the same word is the hardest kind to catch. Fixed three ways, all kept: two `local` statements; **NOMUT and NOEDIT** verdicts (the mutant must exist AND differ from the clean file); and the mutator's stderr captured per tag so every BADMUT row prints a `WHY:` line naming its own cause -- `WHY: ANCHOR MATCHED 0 TIMES IN SCOPE` for Z0 and `WHY: SCOPE BEGIN MATCHED 0 TIMES` for Z1, two different reasons for two differently-named rows.
- **ANCHORS VERIFIED IN THREE TREE STATES BEFORE ANY ROW WAS WRITTEN** (`da9a1aa`, `git show HEAD:` after GSRWIDE landed, and the dirty working tree): all nine match exactly once inside the `gvr` scope in all three, and the **`gvr` region is byte-identical in all three** (70,648 bytes, md5 `26bc256e5a2fd712bd7a28ea28cdff92`), which is what makes a table measured at `da9a1aa` a statement about HEAD. Every anchor is scoped in CODE between two generate headers, per REANCHOR's `sub_scope` idiom.
- **`sim/check_mutation_harness.py` IS GREEN AGAIN: `checked 63 harnesses; 0 finding(s)`, `--selftest PASS`.** That closes TRACK CBANCHOR's open item, which was `FAIL R1: sim/mutate_gain.sh is not in sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` -- this harness was untracked while it was being written.
- **OPEN, not determined:** every number is at the BENCH shape (406 entries, IXW 9), so G5 and G6 in particular say nothing about the build's 1,567 and 11. **No row measures the AREA claim** the codebook exists for (99 RAMB36 against 135) -- G6 doubles the table and no simulation can see it, so a `rom_style` or `NCB` regression would land silently; that needs a Vivado lane. The oracle covers `--tok 0` only. `ONLY` filters rows but not mutations, so the ledger always lists Z0 and Z1.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK CBANCHOR: CBFANOUT killed **nine** rows of `sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh`, all nine are re-anchored and **verdict-preserving**, and the row that justifies its pin is now in the repo instead of in a document

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh`, one line of `sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` (the row about this harness, nothing else), a new section 8 appended to `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_why-mutation-anchors-die.md` (TRACK REANCHOR's file -- extended rather than forked, because it is the same phenomenon), this entry. **`rtl/matvec_core.vhd` NOT touched** -- md5 `c3325ea1f418dcbcaa85f33e47e8c901` at both ends of every run. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (`91f5619a` throughout). **`sim/mutate_gain*.sh` NOT touched** (GAINTEETH's). No hardware. **No Vivado anywhere.**
- **NINE dead rows, MEASURED before anything was changed: K2a K2b K2c K3a K3b K3c K3d K7a K7b.** CBFANOUT said "some". Disposition **9 RE-ANCHOR, 0 RETIRE, 0 CANNOT DECIDE** -- every one names a property today's RTL still has and some column still discriminates on.
- **THE HARNESS WAS NOT ONE OF THE ONES REANCHOR FIXED.** It printed the TAG alongside `ANCHOR FAILED`, which is an inventory rather than a count and is better than the two REANCHOR repaired -- and it exited **rc 0** with no ledger. The only tell was arithmetic nobody does: `kill ratio: 0 KILLED + 0 ABORTED = 0 of 20;  11 SURVIVED`, i.e. **nine rows in the total and in no verdict**. It now carries the same ledger and exits 1, teeth-tested on K2b, K3c, K7a and K10a one at a time.
- **THE NEW CAUSE OF ANCHOR DEATH IS A LOOP SPLIT, AND IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED BY SUBSTITUTION.** REANCHOR's two causes are both "the anchor text is still there and something changed around it". Here the text is gone because the SHAPE changed: one loop that both wrote `cb` and captured the command became **two loops with different bounds and different induction variables** (`c` over copies, `r` over ranks). A row that mutated both halves had ONE anchor spanning both and **no string in the new file is its successor** -- K2b and K3c had to be re-expressed as TWO anchors each. **CBFANOUT's mechanical `CB_COPIES -> CB_RANKS` replacement repairs seven of nine and silently cannot repair two**, and nothing distinguishes the cases without reading the mutation's intent.
- **A NEAR-MISS OF REANCHOR'S DUPLICATE-BLOCK CAUSE, ONE NOTCH WORSE.** `if cb_we = '1' and st = S_IDLE and rst = '0' then` exists **twice** in `matvec_core.vhd`: in `P_CB` at eight spaces and in `P_CB_MODEL` at six. Rows K1a-K1d are alive **only because of whitespace** -- a discriminator that is invisible where REANCHOR's was merely prose. **And the twin is the ORACLE**: a re-indent that made the anchor ambiguous would, on the obvious repair, mutate `P_CB_MODEL` instead of the design, and **a mutated oracle that stops disagreeing scores as `surv`** -- the UNSAFE class, reachable from an edit nobody would think twice about. Every body anchor in the nine re-anchored rows is now scoped `@P_CB@`, a scope being two CODE landmarks (a process header required exactly once in the file, and the first `end process;` after it). Teeth in three directions: the same anchor unscoped gives `ANCHOR 0 MATCHED 2 TIMES`, scoped it applies, and an undefined scope name is a hard error.
- **THE RE-ANCHOR IS VERDICT-PRESERVING, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT.** A re-anchored row that kills proves only that the anchor matched; it does not prove the row still means what it meant. Control: the **OLD harness against the OLD tree** in a detached worktree at `0b34200^`, column for column. **Nine rows, twenty-seven columns each, no difference.**
- **AND THE CONTROL FOUND SOMETHING ELSE: TWO LEGENDS HAD BEEN WRONG FOR WEEKS WHILE THE ROWS RAN GREEN.** K2b's said "SURVIVE -- and that is the finding", K2c's said "SURVIVE: the write lands one cycle EARLIER, which is still legal". Both are **KILLED**, and were killed on the old tree too: `P_CB_MODEL` was added after those legends were written and sees both. **Nothing noticed, because `expected:` is prose and no check compares it to the verdict.** **A row that RUNS is not a row whose legend is true** -- the complement of everything in REANCHOR's document, and harder to see because the output looks like evidence. Both corrected in place with the original quoted.
- **ATTRIBUTION, per row, and four of nine earn nothing.** `CBSTYLE=distributed MODES="A N S P"`, 22 rows, rc 0, `=== every anchor matched; no row was skipped ===`. **`P_CB_MODEL` EARNED K2b and K2c** (KILL in A/N, `surv` in S). **K2a, K3a, K3b, K3c die in every column**, so neither check is the sole witness and an older property would have caught each anyway -- reported rather than folded into a kill count. **K7a/K7b are the useful pair**: with `P_CB_MODEL` demoted they survive on benches C and L and die only on M, reproducing their 2026-08 legend unchanged at the new structure (*"C and L are RELATIONAL; only an ABSOLUTE oracle has an opinion about what the table should contain"*).
- **DID NOT BITE, under their own names.** **K3d SURVIVED all twelve columns** -- every copy writing off rank 0's command registers is invisible to the whole functional closure. That is not a gap; it is **the measured form of CBFANOUT's central claim** and the reason the elaboration pin had to exist. **K10a and K10b SURVIVE at `CBSTYLE=regs`, which is the harness DEFAULT**: the bench runs `ROWS_IF=4 BLK=32`, so `regs` gives `CB_COPIES=4`, `CB_RANKS` is already 4 and K10a is **literally the identity**, while `CB_RANKS=1` still satisfies both halves of the fanout bound. The pin is right -- at four copies there is no fanout problem to have -- but a reader with no environment set sees two SURVIVED rows and could conclude the pin has no teeth, so it is now stated in the class header and both legends.
- **CBFANOUT'S `M2_percopy` CLAIM IS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, AND THE CHECK WAS NEEDED BECAUSE ITS TEETH TABLE WAS NOT REPRODUCIBLE FROM THE REPO.** `git show 0b34200 --stat` lists three files and none is a harness: **the decisive evidence for the change going into build 12 existed only in a document.** Rebuilt as committed rows `K10a` (= M2_percopy) and `K10b` (= M1_collapse) with a new mode **P** that neuters `CHK_CB_RANKS`. MEASURED: both **ABRT in A, N and S and SURVIVE all three benches in P**, the abort being `bound check failure at matvec_core.vhd:371 ... DECL_ELAB` and `:371` being the pin's declaration; in mode P the mutant runs to `CB_RANKS=64 = CB_COPIES` -- **the fix undone -- and every bench PASSES**. So the pin is the sole witness, exactly as claimed. CBFANOUT's own trap reproduced too: these score **ABORTED, not KILLED**, because an out-of-range `natural` fails at `ghdl -r` and no bench log holds an assertion.
- **CBFANOUT'S OPEN ITEM 4 IS ANSWERED FROM PAST RUNS, WITH NO VIVADO.** `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`'s `cb_map` is a **65,536-iteration** nested constant-folding loop building a 65,536-element constant array, in the card source set (`gen_pcieep.py`, `fk33_card.vhd:220`) since `c094867` on 2026-08-31, synthesised by **every `FK33_CARD=1` build** -- build 9 to a shipped bitstream at WNS +0.061 and build 10 to a routed timing summary. `cb_rank_chk_f` is **1,535 iterations of integer arithmetic with an early return and no array**, 43x smaller. **The folding risk is retired.** What is NOT settled: whether Vivado STOPS on the out-of-range `natural` when the pin should fire -- `CHK_CB_STYLE` has never fired in a build, so passing through synthesis is no evidence.
- **MY OWN MEASUREMENT TRAP, and it is the plainest form of the standing one.** A `cd` into the control worktree persisted into the next command, so a run labelled "NEW tree, `CBSTYLE=regs`" was the **OLD tree**. It printed a plausible table **including a `P` column** -- because the old harness does not know mode `P` and silently ran it as a duplicate of mode A with no neuter. **The only tell was that class K10 was absent**, 20 rows where 22 were expected. Re-run with an absolute script path after printing `pwd` and both md5s. **An unknown mode is not an error, it is mode A**; this harness still does not refuse one, and that is open.
- **THE GHDL FOOTPRINT IS 175 MB, NOT 2.13 GiB.** MEASURED by `/usr/bin/time -v`: `Maximum resident set size 175,628 kbytes`, 6.4 s, for a three-row three-mode run. The 2.13 GiB in `CLAUDE.md` is the FULL BOTH-SUITE gate and does not transfer to a targeted mutation run. `free -g` showed **2 to 9 GB available with 22-25 GB of swap in use** under build 11's Vivado (23.41 GB RSS by `/proc/PID/exe`) throughout, and nothing thrashed.
- **GATE (md5 of `sim/regress.sh`, `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` and all three benches identical at both ends):** `--only tb_matvec_cb` **OVERALL PASS 2**, `--only tb_matvec_core` **PASS 2**, `--only tb_matvec_int4` **PASS 2**, `--only tb_matvec_axi` **PASS 1**. FAIL 0 everywhere and every `PASS n` non-zero.
- **`sim/check_mutation_harness.py` STILL FAILS, and not on anything here:** `FAIL R1: sim/mutate_gain.sh is not in sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` -- TRACK GAINTEETH's untracked harness, REANCHOR section 6b's defect in a second instance (R1 reconciles against a disk glob, so another track's in-flight file fails the check for everyone). Deliberately not fixed; the file belongs to a live track.
- **NEXT, branched:** `sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh` is **still not wired to any gate row**, so nothing schedules the nine rows restored here -- if `sim:mutaudit` is wired, these ride with it and section 6b's `mutate_gain.sh` question must be resolved first; if it is not, someone should say so explicitly rather than leaving nine rows re-anchored and unscheduled. If a `ROWS_IF=48` bench is ever run (`sim/tb_matvec_fk33*`), K10a/K10b gain teeth at `regs` as well as at `distributed`.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GSRWIDE: lever L2 landed -- the SwiGLU's `VEC_SWG` step is **61,473 -> 6,176**, values bit-identical, and the whole cost is the LANE COUNT rather than the ports

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/swiglu_mem.vhd`, `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (the `gsr` region and the two new group-port muxes), `sim/tb_swiglu_mem.vhd`, `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`, the generated `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` and `sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd`, new `sim/tb_swiglu_mem_w8.vhd`, `sim/tb_swiglu_mem_w8_9b.vhd`, `sim/tb_llama_top_swgw.vhd`, `sim/mutate_swg_wide.sh`, `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-swiglu-on-the-group-port.md`, this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (PATHFREE's, and gates were live). **`rtl/attn_*.vhd` NOT touched.** No hardware. No Vivado anywhere.
- **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` IS RELEASED.** It stayed buildable at every point; `--only cardtop`, `--only gdnstale` and `--only fk33card` are all green and all three generators were regenerated and diffed.
- **THE ANSWER, and both halves are MEASURED.** `swiglu_mem` at LANES 8 through a new wide face is **3,085 cycles at N = 12288** (`sim:tb_swiglu_mem_w8_9b`), which turns DSIDE's OPEN item -- *"LANES = 8 is an extrapolation of SWGFAST's law past its measured points"* -- into a measurement that agrees. The `gsr` adapter's **three serial one-element passes become two group-port passes**, `3(N+2) = 36,870 -> 2(N/8+2) = 3,076`, because the group READ port already carried TWO operand regions at one address and G and U ARE `v_reg_a` and `v_reg_b`. Step `61,473 -> 6,176` keeping DSIDE's 14-cycle residual explicit; **DERIVED 1,769,504 cycles a token over 32 steps, 5.88% striped, 2.86% flat.** That is DSIDE's L2 figure confirmed to 32 cycles.
- **THE CYCLE MODEL IS EXACT AT THREE DELTAS, which is what separates a structural relationship from a fit.** MEASURED in `llama_top` over 3 tokens: 82,329 (shipping) / 79,653 (LANES 8 narrow) / 76,173 (GRP 4 wide) / 75,405 (GRP 8 wide), against DERIVED deltas 2,676 / 6,156 / 6,924 -- **all three to the cycle**. All four configurations produce the SAME four pinned landmarks, `EXP_STEPH` included, so it is the whole region-write STREAM that is identical.
- **THE COST IS THE LANE REPLICATION, NOT THE PORTS, AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE LEVER INVITES.** ESTIMATE (no Vivado lane was available, none of this is synthesised): `wgmux` 2:1 -> 3:1 is +0 to +20 LUT, `rgmux` +12 LUT, the adapter's group face +365 FF net, `greq` free. `SWG_LANES = 8` is 7 extra copies of a datapath with two 32x32 multiplies and a sigmoid -- **DSIDE ESTIMATE +112 DSP / +16k LUT, mine +56 DSP, and the two differ by 2x with neither drawn.**
- **GIVEN BUILD 10's -5.819 ns, THE ASK IS EXPLICITLY NOT "SET IT TO 8".** Defaults `SWG_LANES => 1, SWG_WIDE => false` add literally nothing (the `elsif` condition is constant false, the wide generate does not elaborate, the asserts are clocked). **`SWG_WIDE => true, SWG_LANES => 1` buys 393,280 cycles a token for the two muxes and ~160 flops and NO lane replication** -- that is the point to take if the next build needs cycles and cannot afford area. `SWG_LANES = 8` needs an OOC A/B first; section 4.5 of the write-up names it.
- **TEETH: 46 rows plus an 11-row re-run, and the most useful result is about the CHECK.** `greq`, the new group-port guard, **had NO TEETH as first written**: properties (a) and (b) compare each client against `greq`'s own copy of the selection rule, and a defect IN THE MUX leaves that copy intact, so both mux mutants were killed by an existing property (P4) and their `_G` controls with `greq` disabled gave the identical kill. Property (c) -- *the port must carry whoever asked*, reading the mux OUTPUT with no copy of the rule -- now kills both, **14.8x earlier in simulated time and naming the client and the port**. That is a smaller claim than "a new guard caught a new class" and it is the one the controls support.
- **Four mutants are NO-OPS at the card's geometry by construction** (`SWG_GRP = LANES` makes `(k*GRP)/LANES` be `k` and `lane0` be 0), so every one got a second configuration at `SWG_LANES = 4`; three bite there. **`M1_be_tail` survives at BOTH and that is correct**: `swiglu_mem` pins `N mod LANES = 0` and `gsr` asserts `n = NN`, so no elaborable configuration has a partial final group -- stronger than WIDEDRAIN's version, where the case was merely absent from the schedule.
- **ANOTHER TRACK'S EDIT VOIDED 27 OF 46 ROWS AND IT LOOKED LIKE SUCCESS.** MIDGAP wrote `rtl/attn_block.vhd` mid-matrix; the first symptom was a loud `DID NOT ANALYZE` on 27 rows, the second was **every row reporting `KILLED(ABORT)` including `_N` controls that CANNOT be killed**. A table copied from that log would have credited this gate with twenty kills it did not make. Fixed by snapshotting `rtl/ sim/ tb/ tools/` to `/mnt/storage` and restoring the MIDGAP files from `git show HEAD:`; both md5s recorded and re-checked. **Whatever holds `llama_top` next: a mutation matrix needs a snapshot, not the repo.**
- **GATE (md5 of every file these rows compile recorded at start and end, all MATCHED):** `tb_swiglu_mem` PASS 4, `tb_llama_top_swg` PASS 2, `seamgate_swg` PASS 1, `tb_llama_top` PASS 14, `cardtop` PASS 3, `gdnstale` PASS 1, `fk33card` PASS 1. **FAIL 0 everywhere.**
- **BASELINE_PASS NOT raised** for the three new rows (`sim/regress.sh` is PATHFREE's). The next full unfiltered gate should raise it by **5** -- DSIDE's `tb_region_drain`, WIDEDRAIN's `tb_llama_top_wdrain` and these three -- and quote that run.
- **NEXT, branched:** if an OOC A/B says `SWG_LANES = 8` fits, the card takes `(8, true)` and 5.88%; if it does not, take `(1, true)` for 1.31% at near-zero area and revisit after CBFANOUT frees the CLB budget. **L4 (`gvr`, 465,920 cycles) is now the cheapest remaining item on DSIDE's list**: `rmsnorm_bf_mem` needs the same pair of wide faces `swiglu_mem` just grew, and `rgmux`/`wgmux` have the shape a fourth client plugs into.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK CBFANOUT: build 10's -5.819 ns net had **1,536 sinks**, and the fix is to replicate the command **per ROW** -- fanout 1,536 -> 48, **-19,344 flops**, and **no extra cycle**

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` (architecture only -- the entity is byte-identical, MEASURED `054989ed` both sides, so no wrapper is affected), `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_codebook-command-fanout-per-row.md`, this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (gates may be live). **`sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh` NOT edited** -- it is TRACK REANCHOR's and this change breaks some of its anchors; the exact replacements are in section "Consequences for other files". No hardware. **No Vivado anywhere** -- the workstation lane is build 11's, the BC-250's is HDRCOST's.
- **THE ANSWER: CHANGE IT, AND THE CHANGE IS SMALLER THAN THE ONE THE FILE ITSELF PROPOSES.** Build 10 failed routed at WNS -5.819 ns with 17,194 failing endpoints, all ten worst paths `cb_addr_reg[i]/C -> cbw_a_reg[c][i]/D`, register to register with no logic, i.e. **pure net delay**. `CB_COPIES = 1536` command registers x 13 bits = **19,968 flop D-inputs on 13 nets** against 17,194 failing endpoints. Replicating the write COMMAND **per ROW** (`CB_RANKS = 48`) instead of per COPY cuts max fanout per command bit **1,536 -> 48**, keeps **`CB_WR_LAT = 1`**, and **deletes 19,344 flip-flops**.
- **THE ORIGINAL DESIGN WAS ALREADY PER-ROW; the per-copy explosion was never decided.** `git log -S CB_COPIES` gives three commits and `fe0d3c8` is titled *"A: replicate the codebook **per row**"*. Lever C then reused `CB_COPIES` as the bound of the command register array, and the 32x followed silently. This restores the stated intent rather than inventing a structure.
- **THE INVARIANT IS PRESERVED BY THE SAME ARGUMENT THE SHIPPING DESIGN USES, NOT A WEAKER ONE.** Every `cbw_*(r)` is assigned in one loop from one expression of the PORTS and of `st`/`rst`, with no term depending on `r`, so all ranks hold identical values at every instant; the predicate "copy c writes at this edge" is therefore independent of c. **The proof at `:266-278` never used the cardinality of the register set nor the injectivity of the map**, which is exactly why coarsening it is safe. The registers stay an ANTICHAIN -- none feeds another -- so port-to-copy depth is exactly 1 for every copy, identically.
- **AND IT IS MEASURED, NOT ONLY ARGUED: K3d.** `CBSTYLE=distributed bash sim/mutate_matvec_cb.sh` (unmodified repo harness) scores **K3d SURVIVED in all nine columns** -- *"every replica writes off replica 0's command registers ... a true equivalent mutant today, because every command register holds the same command"*. K3d is `NR = 1`, the **extreme** of this change; this design is `NR = 48`, strictly between K3d and today's 1,536, and inherits the equivalence. K3d is rejected here on **fanout alone** (its rank-to-copy net has 1,536 sinks, which is build 10's failure wearing another name).
- **WHY 48, DERIVED:** max fanout is `max(NR, CB_COPIES/NR)`, minimised at `sqrt(1536) = 39.2`. 48 is the nearest value that is also a PHYSICAL cluster, and for a reason unrelated to the codebook -- the BLK lanes of a row share an adder tree, so the placer clusters them anyway (`fe0d3c8`'s own defence).
- **MEASURED AND REJECTED -- DO NOT RETRY: the `CB_BCAST` construction the file names at `:299-309`** (port -> rank -> `cbw_*` -> cb, `CB_WR_LAT := 2`). It reaches the **same two fanout numbers** while adding a cycle, adding 624 flops instead of removing 19,344, and **tightening the caller obligation by one cycle that one shipping caller does not have**. MEASURED from the RTL: `matvec_int4_desc_axi`'s `S_CB -> S_START -> S_WAIT` gives the core `start` exactly **two** cycles after the last `cb_we`, so at `CB_WR_LAT = 2` the write lands on the very edge that leaves `S_IDLE` -- legal by the letter of `P_CB_CHK`, **zero margin** -- and `core_start <= '0'` is a per-cycle default (`:733`), so `start` is a **one-cycle pulse** that any deferring interlock would DROP, hanging the core. Also rejected: a multicycle constraint (the captures are unconditional every cycle, so there is no window to relax without first gating them); raising `CB_LANES_PER_COPY` (moves fanout onto the READ side, which is in the multiply path, and gives back lever C's -42,633 LUT); removing the `dont_touch` attributes (they are what stops the replicas merging, and the `a4828ab` FF arithmetic proves they currently work).
- **VALUE ORACLE, both styles and both versions:** `tb_matvec_core` vs `ref/matvec_int4.c` -- **464 stage + 343 output values, 0 mismatches** in all four of {OLD,NEW} x {regs,distributed}; `tb_matvec_cb_contract` and `tb_matvec_cb_lockstep` **8 of 8 PASS**. The bench geometry is ROWS_IF=4, giving `CB_COPIES=128` and `CB_RANKS=4`, so the change **is** exercised.
- **THE CARD GEOMETRY, which no bench reaches, in BOTH directions.** Elaborated at ROWS_IF=48 BLK=32 distributed: `CB_COPIES=1536 CB_LANES_PER_COPY=1 CB_RANKS=48 CB_WR_LAT=1`. Negative control with `CB_RANKS` forced back to `CB_COPIES`: `bound check failure ... work.matvec_core(rtl).DECL_ELAB`, i.e. the out-of-range-`natural` pin refuses the build, the same mechanism `CHK_CB_STYLE` uses.
- **TEETH, with an attribution-control mode for the new pin** (A all live / **P pin neutered** / S `P_CB_MODEL` demoted), at `CB_STYLE=distributed`: `CTRL SURVIVED`; **`M2_percopy` (the fix undone, i.e. exactly what build 10 built) fires the pin in A and S and SURVIVES ALL THREE BENCHES in P** -- so **the pin EARNED that kill and nothing else in the project can see it**; `M1_collapse` (NR=1) the same; `M3_offbyone` killed by the pre-existing index bound, not by the pin; `M4_rankskew` (upper half of the ranks one cycle late) killed by `P_CB_CHK` in every mode; `M5_deepen` (uniform extra stage) killed in A and P and **survives in S**, so `P_CB_MODEL` earned it, reproducing the recorded K2b result at the new structure; `M7_liveaddr` control kills, proving the harness still bites what the old one bit.
- **THE PIN'S FIRST VERSION COULD NOT SEE THE DEFECT IT EXISTS FOR, MEASURED.** It checked only that the copy-to-rank map is onto and contiguous -- and **`CB_RANKS = CB_COPIES` and `CB_RANKS = 1` are BOTH legal onto maps**, so it passed over both regressions. The fanout bound (`CB_RANKS <= ROWS_IF`, `CB_COPIES/CB_RANKS <= BLK`) was added for exactly that and is what M1 and M2 now fire on. At the card both hold **with equality** (48 and 32): the design point, not slack.
- **MUTATIONS THAT DID NOT BITE, under their own names.** (a) **`M6_rotate`**: rotating the copy-to-rank map preserves both fanout numbers and is functionally identical, and **the pin rejects it anyway** -- the pin is strictly STRONGER than the property it guards, recorded as an over-constraint rather than hidden. (b) **Every functional bench survives the fix itself, and that is CORRECT**: the change is provably value-neutral, so **no simulation can score it**. The RTL is verified by construction and by the pin; **its BENEFIT is unmeasured**. The pre-existing harness said so in advance -- its row **L4** names exactly this net and says *"Instrument: STA, not simulation."*
- **AREA: -19,344 FF, DERIVED and cross-checked against an independent measurement.** `a4828ab` MEASURED lever C at `CLB FF +13,195 (DERIVED +13,200, residual -5)`, and that decomposes **exactly** as command registers `+19,344` (1536*13 - 48*13) plus `cb` becoming LUTRAM `-6,144` (48*16*8). So the 19,968 command flops are not read off the source; they are the only decomposition reproducing a measured number to 5 flops in 13,195. **FALSIFIABLE PREDICTION: lever C's FF delta at ROWS_IF=48 goes from +13,200 to -6,144**, i.e. lever C becomes FF-negative as well as LUT-negative. One OOC synthesis settles it exactly.
- **TIMING: ESTIMATE, DELIBERATELY UNQUANTIFIED.** What is DERIVED is the input -- 1,536 -> 48 sinks, a factor of 32, on the net carrying all ten worst paths. **No WNS number is offered and no ratio is taken from build 9's +0.061 against build 10's -5.819**: those builds differ in the levers as well as the area, and this project has twice been burned reading scatter as slope. Settled only by a routed `FK33_CARD=1` build; `phys_opt` over-promises 0.4-0.6 ns on this part and has inverted a verdict.
- **THE GATE ROWS WERE NOT RUN, AND THAT IS A GAP, NOT A PASS.** The box was at **1.6-1.8 GB available with 21-23 GB of swap in use** under build 11's Vivado (23.5 GB RSS, MEASURED via `/proc/PID/exe`), against a MEASURED full-gate peak of 2.13 GiB, and swap was **rising** throughout. Per the standing rule the correct action was to stop and say so. What WAS run covers the three benches that instantiate `matvec_core` directly, at both styles and both versions, and the **entity is byte-identical** across the change with every hunk inside the architecture, which bounds what a wrapper row could newly catch without reducing it to zero. **To run when there is headroom:** `REGRESS_SCRATCH=/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/cbfanout/gate1 bash sim/regress.sh --only tb_matvec --keep` and read the `OVERALL PASS n` line (`--only` is a SUBSTRING; a pattern matching nothing still prints `REGRESSION: PASS`).
- **A TRAP HIT, AND IT NEARLY COST ANOTHER TRACK.** With memory exhausted, two `ghdl-mcode` processes looked like orphans of my own SIGPIPE'd debug run. **`/proc/PID/cwd` showed PID 352230 in `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/gsrwide/` -- TRACK GSRWIDE's, not mine.** Identifying by the kernel's view rather than by a command line is the only reason it was not killed. Also hit: reading a background log **before it flushed** and reporting a completed 8-row table as empty output.
- **CORRECTION, same day, appended in place: the "GATE ROWS WERE NOT RUN" bullet above is WITHDRAWN.** Memory recovered after `0b34200` was committed and the rows were run against the committed RTL (md5 `c3325ea1` throughout). MEASURED, four invocations each with its own per-run scratch: `--only tb_matvec_cb` **OVERALL PASS 2 FAIL 0**, `--only tb_matvec_axi` **PASS 1 FAIL 0**, `--only tb_matvec_int4` **PASS 2 FAIL 0**, `--only tb_matvec_core` **PASS 2 FAIL 0** -- **seven rows, 0 FAIL, and every `PASS n` non-zero**, which is the check that matters because `--only` is a SUBSTRING and a pattern matching nothing still prints `REGRESSION: PASS` with `PASS 0`. Bench md5s identical at both ends of the window (`be5fc1e8`, `877fb15b`, `5522a105`); `sim/regress.sh` untouched (`91f5619a`). **`sim/tb_matvec_fk33*` were deliberately NOT run** -- ROWS_IF=48, 200 ms stop-time, optional rows needing a `.mv4i`, and build 11 still held 23-25 GB of swap -- **so they stay open.**
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) The timing benefit is entirely unmeasured; no Vivado ran. (2) Whether fixing this net lets build 10's levers close or merely moves the failure to the next structure -- inherited unchanged from the postmortem. (3) The -19,344 FF prediction is DERIVED, not MEASURED. (4) **Whether Vivado folds `cb_rank_chk_f`**, which loops 1,535 times at the card geometry; GHDL does, Vivado is untested. If it does not fold, the build **errors rather than silently mis-builds**, so the failure mode is safe -- but it has not been observed either way. (5) The wrapper gate rows, above. (6) `CB_ROWS_PER_COPY > 1` is admitted by the pin (it degenerates to today's identity map) but no bench was run at that setting.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK REANCHOR: the dead rows were **27, not 22**, and **five of them died with nothing inside the anchor edited** -- a copy-pasted state machine and a comment quoting the code

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/mutate_llama_top_kv.sh`, `sim/mutate_attn_kv_seam.sh`, `sim/mutate_rmswire.sh`, `sim/mutate_fk33_seam.sh`, `sim/mutate_llama_top_normuram.sh` (**RETIRED to a tombstone**), `sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv` (its row), `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_why-mutation-anchors-die.md`, this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited.** **No RTL touched** -- `rtl/llama_top.vhd` is GSRWIDE's, `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` is HDRCOST's; both were read only. No hardware. No Vivado anywhere.
- **THE INVENTORY IS 27, AND THE BRIEF'S PER-HARNESS ATTRIBUTION WAS WRONG IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** MEASURED by anchor replay at `00d92f1`, with the replay patched to print the row TAG beside each failure: `llama_top_kv` R6 R7 R7b R8(A) N1 N2 VN2 VR7 VR7b (9), `llama_top_normuram` U1 U2 U3 U4 U6 U6x U6b U6bx U7 (9), `attn_kv_seam` R3 R5 R5b L1 (**4**, not the 5 the brief names -- R4 is alive), `rmswire` R4 R7 R8 R11 (**4**, not R3 and R9, which are both alive), `fk33_seam` M9 (1). MUTAUDIT counted anchor-failure LINES; a row can contribute two (`mutate_rtl2` prints one per half) and a `run_case` prints a third. **A count is not an inventory, and the diagnostic is on stderr detached from its row, which is why the tags had to be added to get one.**
- **DISPOSITION: 21 RE-ANCHOR, 6 RETIRE, 0 CANNOT DECIDE.**
- **THE PATTERN, AND IT IS THE POINT OF THE TRACK: FIVE OF 27 DIED WITH NOTHING INSIDE THE ANCHOR EDITED.** (a) `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s `gsr` (SWG_REAL) adapter is a **byte-identical copy of `gvr`'s write-back state machine** -- at HEAD the two differ **only in the comment above them** -- so `if rav_d = '1' then` went from 1 match to 2 and killed `rmswire` R7 and R8 and `llama_top_kv` N2 and VN2 at once. **Uniqueness is a property of the FILE, not of the anchor.** (b) `9e3348e` added two COMMENT lines quoting `vref_r(lay_r*N_KVH + kvh)`, taking `mutate_rtl_n`'s count from 3 to 5 and voiding `attn_kv_seam` L1. **A substring count counts comments**, which is the `gen_pcieep.py` `\bllama_top\b` guard again.
- **AND THE THIRD CAUSE COST REAL EVIDENCE TWICE: AN ANCHOR MUST NAME ONLY WHAT THE MUTATION CHANGES.** `llama_top_kv` N1 mutates `w_exp` and anchored on `"w_mant => wsel,    w_exp => NORM_W_EXP,"`. It has been broken **twice by two different edits to `w_mant`, a port it never touched** -- `9f690a0`, re-anchored 2026-08-29 with a comment explaining the breakage, then `47c9d9c`. **The 2026-08-29 re-anchor reproduced the defect it was fixing.** Now anchored on `w_exp` alone.
- **A PARTIAL MUTANT REPORTED AS A KILL, MEASURED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** `attn_kv_seam` L1's fourth site is applied by `add_mut`, **whose rc was never read**; its python exits before writing on a bad anchor, so the file keeps sites 1-3 and the row runs. Pre-fix, with site 4 broken: `MUTATION ANCHOR MATCHED 0 TIMES` on stderr, then **`L1  KILLED`** -- three of four sites, green, under the full row's name. Post-fix: `L1 ANCHOR FAILED (a later site, so the mutant was PARTIAL and was NOT run)`. `llama_top_kv` R8 had the identical shape and is gated the same way.
- **THE FIX FOR THE COPY-PASTE IS A SCOPE STATED IN CODE, NOT A LONGER ANCHOR.** New `mutate_rtl_scoped` / `sub_scope`: two generate headers (`gvr : if NORM_REAL...`, `gsr : if SWG_REAL...`), each required exactly once, with the anchor required N times BETWEEN them. **Anchoring on the distinguishing comment would work today** and is the mistake this project has already recorded twice.
- **AND "SAFE" WAS NOT ENOUGH: THE ROWS VANISHED.** `mutation_harness_audit.tsv` classifies these harnesses SAFE and that is correct -- no false SURVIVED is printed -- but `[ -n "$D" ] && run_case ...` **skips the row silently and a shorter table reads like a shorter table.** Nine `llama_top_kv` rows were absent for up to twenty-one days. Both harnesses now keep a **VANISHED-ROW LEDGER**: every mutator failure is recorded by tag, printed in a block of its own at the end, and the script **exits nonzero**. Teeth, MEASURED both ways: clean tree -> `=== every anchor matched; no row was skipped ===`, rc 0; one anchor made impossible -> `=== ROWS THAT DID NOT RUN: 1 ===` naming the row, rc 1.
- **`sim/mutate_llama_top_normuram.sh` IS RETIRED TO A TOMBSTONE.** Nine of its ten rows were dead because `47c9d9c` (RMSWIRE), `c094867` (GAIN16) and `21db25b` (GWTWO) replaced the store it tests three times over. **`sim/mutate_rmswire.sh` is already the successor**: same wrapper, byte-identical `G_NORMW` generics and `LAND_NORMW` landmarks, same `FILES` closure read from the same owner, and **four attribution columns where normuram had one three-way verdict** -- its R9 says so in its own row text ("TRACK NORMURAM's U5 re-asked of the rewritten loader"). The file now exits 2 and carries a **per-row successor map**. `rmswire` R4 and R11 (normuram's U2 and U7) are retired with it: `gw_pick` returns 1 unconditionally since `21db25b`, so there is no sub-word to permute and "GW forced to 1" is **the identity**. `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s own `wsubsel` comment says so.
- **R11/U7 ARE THE SHARPEST RETIREMENT: A ROW WHOSE EXPECTED VERDICT IS `SURVIVED` IS THE HARDEST KIND TO NOTICE HAS STOPPED RUNNING.** It is `mutate_attn_sweep_pipe`'s P7 in a second place, and the SAFE class only changes it from a false `SURVIVED` to no line at all.
- **TEETH, MEASURED, both directions, from a detached `git worktree` at `00d92f1`** (the shared `rtl/llama_top.vhd` is +368 lines dirty from GSRWIDE and a `tb_llama_top` row is 13 minutes): `fk33_seam` M0 `SURVIVED` / M9 `KILLED` by **P7, the property in its own legend**, verdict `KILLED` and not `KILLED(PRIOR)` so the harness's built-in attribution credits `tb_fk33_seam.vhd`; impossible anchor -> `ANCHOR FAILED ... ABORT 1`. `attn_kv_seam` S1 `KILLED` (lane control), R3 `KILLED(HANG)`, R5 `KILLED(HANG)`, **R5b `KILLED` by the ADDRESS property at `tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd:1028`, not by the value oracle, which is exactly what its legend claims**, L1 `KILLED` by Q1 against `ref/attn_block_vec.c`; four impossible anchors, four `ANCHOR FAILED`. `llama_top_kv` C0 `SURVIVED` (control), **R6 `KILLED` with `KV faults=5440`, ALL of it `read placement`, every other counter zero** -- the read-placement property is the only one that can see a swapped base -- and **N1 `KILLED` with `degenerate residuals=16`, every other counter zero, with its built-in attribution control `N1x SURVIVED`** against the default gate row, which does not elaborate the NORM_REAL adapter. `rmswire` R0 `SURVIVES` (control) and **R7 `KILLED` with `K:landmarks` in ALL FOUR columns: the kill belongs to the pre-existing token landmarks and to NEITHER assertion**, reported under its own name because that is what the columns exist to say. **N2 `KILLED` by the P14 landmark hash with EVERY structural counter at zero, control `N2x SURVIVED`** -- schedule, skew, degenerate residuals, token position and KV faults all 0, so the value landmark is the only thing in the bench that can see a write-back one element short. **`rmswire` R5b, the row ADDED to carry the retired normuram U3, BITES** (`K:landmarks` in all four columns), so retiring U3 costs no coverage and the m7 reversal is held by the landmarks rather than by either assertion. **R8 landed last with the same verdict and the same attribution**, so all three re-anchored `rmswire` rows are `K:landmarks` in every column -- **and that uniformity is a result, not a formality: NEITHER assertion earned a single kill across the three.** It does not follow that either is worthless (all three mutants are VALUE faults and both assertions are SCHEDULE checks aimed at a load race these rows do not create); what follows is narrower and is the honest form: **no row re-anchored here discriminates on either assertion, so this track re-earned nothing for them.**
- **MEASURED AND REJECTED -- DO NOT RETRY.** Raising L1's count 3 -> 5 (it edits two COMMENTS, and a count that includes comments can be satisfied by adding one). Disambiguating `gvr` from `gsr` by anchoring on the comment above the block (the only textual discriminator at HEAD, and it makes a mutation row depend on prose). Re-anchoring normuram's nine rows (produces a second harness mutating the same lines of the same file against the same landmarks). Verifying an anchor against the working tree only -- **three proposed anchors matched once in the dirty tree and TWICE at HEAD**, because GSRWIDE's uncommitted edit had already wrapped `gsr`'s copy in an extra `else`. Running the teeth in the shared checkout at all.
- **FOUND ON THE WAY OUT, AND IT BLOCKS THE PROPOSED `sim:mutaudit` GATE ROW: `sim/check_mutation_harness.py` PASSES HERE AND FAILS ON A FRESH CLONE OF THE TREE IT WAS COMMITTED IN.** MEASURED: `git clone` at `da9a1aa` -> 61 harnesses on disk, `FAIL R1: the manifest names sim/mutate_swg_wide.sh, which does not exist`, 1 finding; against 62 and 0 in the working checkout. **R1 builds its harness list from a DISK GLOB (`os.listdir`), not from git**, so the completeness rule is relative to the machine it runs on. `sim/mutate_swg_wide.sh` is **TRACK GSRWIDE's** (its own header, line 6), was on disk uncommitted when MUTAUDIT swept the tree, and was audited into the manifest MUTAUDIT then committed -- **a committed file referencing an uncommitted one**, and the ONLY such row of 62. **NOT FIXED HERE, DELIBERATELY**: committing GSRWIDE's in-flight file under this track's message is the exact cross-track capture that has already caught four tracks in one day, and changing R1 to read `git ls-files` is not obviously right (a harness under development is untracked and arguably still needs auditing). **Do not wire `sim:mutaudit` until this is resolved** -- it would go red on its first CI run naming a file nobody had touched.
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED.** (1) **NOTHING IN THE TREE HAS TEETH ON THE CODEBOOK.** MEASURED: `grep -l 'cbrom\|CBMAP\|CBMARK\|ixrom'` over all 62 `sim/mutate_*.sh` returns **nothing**. `c094867` made the gain store an 11-bit index ROM plus a 1,567-entry codebook -- a packer/unpacker pair, the recorded `m7 mutant` shape, exactly what U2 and U3 existed to attack. Retiring normuram did not create the hole (it arrived with `c094867` and those rows were already dead); it made it visible. (2) Rows re-anchored, replay-clean at HEAD **and** in the working tree, but **NOT YET RUN**, so DERIVED and not MEASURED: `llama_top_kv` R7 R7b R8 VR7 VR7b VN2 -- each replay-clean at HEAD and in the working tree, each with its impossible-anchor teeth, none RUN (`rmswire` R8 landed and is MEASURED). **And `rmswire`'s T0-T3 tap rows were never run by this track at all**: `ONLY` filters them and they are judged by `sim/tb_rmswire_loadrace.vhd`, so the `w_active` half of that harness is untouched and unverified here in either direction. **And R7/VR7/R7b/VR7b carry a PREDICTION this track did not test**: their legends (TRACK C1) say R7 survives byte-identically and R7b is KILLED(ABORT) by `vsh_neg`, and those statements predate `1b8d28f`, the commit that broke the anchor. (3) **No per-property ablation was run**: every attribution claim here is "which check spoke first", read from each harness's own classification, which is weaker than disabling the credited check and re-running. (4) `gsr` remains a copy-paste of `gvr` with nothing that says so to a tool; the scope works around it and the next anchor written into either will hit the same wall.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK MUTAUDIT: **5 of 62 mutation harnesses reported a zero-match anchor as SURVIVED**, one row is a no-op TODAY, six more harnesses have silently lost 22 rows between them, and three could not run at all

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/mutate_attn_block.sh`, `sim/mutate_attn_score_early.sh`, `sim/mutate_attn_sweep_pipe.sh`, `sim/mutate_normw.sh`, `sim/mutate_a_geom.sh` (the five fixes), `sim/mutate_attn_score_hdr.sh` (its Z0 verdict is now branched on), `sim/mutate_fk33_seam.sh` and `sim/mutate_llama_top_smp.sh` (one word each), new `sim/check_mutation_harness.py`, new `sim/mutation_harness_audit.tsv`, `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-mutation-harness-that-did-not-mutate.md`, this entry. **`sim/regress.sh` NOT edited** (gates may be live; editing the runner mid-run corrupts its tail) -- the three lines to add are in section 8 of the write-up. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` NOT touched** (GSRWIDE owns it). No hardware. No Vivado anywhere.
- **THE COUNT: 62 harnesses. 5 VULNERABLE, 57 SAFE by six different mechanisms.** Every one of the five was demonstrated **in both directions** by running it -- impossible anchor, then the real one: `mutate_attn_block` `M1 SURVIVED` / `M1 KILLED`; `mutate_attn_score_early` `E1_on SURVIVED` / `ABORT(DUTASSERT)`; `mutate_attn_sweep_pipe` `P1_on SURVIVED` / `ABORT(LANG)`; `mutate_normw` `bench PASS R_XN oracle 9/9` (byte for byte the unmutated M0 row) / `8/9`; `mutate_a_geom` `PASS (want FAIL)` / `FAIL`, with **no diagnostic at all** in the `a_geom` case because a `sed -i` that matches nothing exits 0.
- **IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL: `mutate_attn_sweep_pipe.sh`'s P7 ANCHOR HAS MATCHED ZERO TIMES SINCE `4e9915b`** (TRACK MIDGAP, the same day). Since then the row has run the PRISTINE design and printed `P7_on SURVIVED`, while the script's own legend explains that survival as *"a pure schedule change; the value oracle CANNOT see it, by construction"*. **The more reasonable the expected-survivor story, the less likely anyone checks the mutant exists.** With the fix in place that row is now `BADMUT` and the script exits nonzero.
- **THE RETROSPECTIVE QUESTION, ANSWERED HONESTLY: from the committed tables and logs alone, NO.** The tables carry only the verdict word, the one diagnostic goes to stderr detached from its row, and **no raw run log from any of the five is committed**. **But it is answerable by a route that runs no simulation:** replay the anchors against the RTL as both stood at that commit, with the row functions stubbed. Its positive control is the single anchor failure this project has already recorded (`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_c1-vref-layer.md`, row N1 of `mutate_llama_top_kv.sh`, broken by `9f690a0`) and the replay **reproduces it exactly, at that commit, in seconds**.
- **AND THE REPLAY FOUND SIX MORE HARNESSES WITH DEAD ANCHORS AT `56d13e3`.** In the SAFE class the rows do not print SURVIVED -- they **vanish**, which reads as a shorter report rather than a failure: `mutate_llama_top_kv` **9**, `mutate_llama_top_normuram` **9** (most of its table, U1-U7), `mutate_attn_kv_seam` **R3 R4 R5 R5b L1**, `mutate_rmswire` **R3 R9**, `mutate_fk33_seam` **1**, plus `attn_sweep_pipe` P7 above. **Not re-anchored here** -- deciding what each mutation should now mean against refactored RTL belongs to whoever owns those semantics.
- **THIRD FINDING: THREE HARNESSES COULD NOT RUN AT ALL.** `mutate_normw`, `mutate_fk33_seam` and `mutate_llama_top_smp` omit `rtl/gdn_conv_w_mem.vhd` (added by `748ff91`) from `FILES`, so `gdn_state_store` fails to analyse and **every row reported `ANALYSIS`**. One word each. MEASURED after: `normw M0 bench PASS R_XN oracle 9/9`, `fk33_seam M0 SURVIVED`, `llama_top_smp C0 SURVIVED` on both benches.
- **THE FIXES, RE-VALIDATED.** `__ANCHOR_FAIL__` sentinel + a distinct `BADMUT` verdict that is neither KILLED nor SURVIVED + a `Z0` self-teeth row + a `Z0SEEN`/`NBAD` gate the run **exits on**. All five print `Z0 ... BADMUT / Z0SEEN=1 NBAD=0`. `mutate_a_geom` and `mutate_attn_block` were re-run IN FULL and reproduce their committed tables row for row (`TOTAL 23 KILLED 15 SURVIVED 6 ABORT 0 BADMUT 0`). **No shared helper**: the five have three different shapes, so one library would cover three of five and would add a shared mutable input to scripts whose main feature is a private self-copy taken to avoid exactly that.
- **`sim/mutate_attn_score_hdr.sh` HAD THE Z0 ROW AND NOTHING READ ITS VERDICT.** It printed `Z0_on` into the summary for a human. Now `Z0SEEN` gates the exit. **A self-teeth row whose result nothing branches on is decoration.**
- **THE PROPOSED GATE ROW, WRITTEN BUT NOT WIRED: `sim:mutaudit`** = `python3 sim/check_mutation_harness.py --selftest`, ~1.5 s, no GHDL/Vivado/card. R1 manifest completeness (**the way this defect arrives is a new harness written by copying an old one, and three of the five are copies of each other**), R2 a SELFTEETH script must really have the row, print BADMUT and branch on it, R3 a call-site detector. **Its teeth are its own selftest against eight MEASURED states** -- 3 positives and 5 negatives, two of which (`attn_kv_seam`, `llama_top_kv`) carry the same `echo ""` helper as the positives and are saved only by their call sites, so a detector keying on the helper alone would name them too. R1/R2 teeth-checked against three mutated manifests. **Exact `regress.sh` lines in the write-up; apply when no gate is live.**
- **MEASURED AND REJECTED -- DO NOT RETRY.** Classifying by grepping for `echo ""` (nine have it, three are vulnerable). Classifying by a guard token anywhere in the file (`[ -n "$mutdir" ]` is the FILE-SELECTION test in `attn_block`'s `run_case`, and a token search called it safe). A greedy `.*"\$(\w+)"` to find the mutdir argument (matches `"$GEN"`, the LAST argument -- the detector's first draft called `attn_block` SAFE against a MEASURED vulnerability and **its own selftest caught it**). Running the replay with `MUT_REPO` at a historical tree (**most scripts use `cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."` and ignore it; 24 harnesses were briefly "failing" because the replay could not open their sources** -- run the copy from INSIDE the historical tree). Hand-transcribing an anchor to bisect it (a hand-typed P7 anchor said it was dead at the commit that ADDED the harness; the replay was right). Incrementing a counter inside `$( )` (`a_geom`'s first `mrun` lost `Z0SEEN` to the subshell -- **the fix's own validation was the thing the fix was about**).
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED:** 49 harnesses are **DERIVED, not MEASURED** -- their guard text is quoted per file in the manifest and returns before any tool runs, but they were not individually run with an impossible anchor; **50 of 62 apply the mutation inside their row function**, which is exactly what makes the cheap replay unavailable and leaves a full run each as the only route. Which committed tables, if any, contain the P7 no-op (grep of `docs/` for `P7` found none after `4e9915b`, but that is a grep, not an audit). The 22 dead rows are not re-anchored. Whether the other rows of the eight touched scripts still mean what their descriptions claim -- this track checked only that a no-op is distinguishable. `hw/fk33/*.py` selftests that apply textual mutations are outside this audit.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GDNSYNTH: the gdnadapt extraction still did NOT synthesise; and `B_RECUR_LANES=16` changes LUT by **-7,545 in the flat arm and +7,688 in the card's arm** -- opposite signs, same tree, one variable

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py` (generator: one missing PORT in `PROLOGUE`, closure check widened from generics to the whole entity header), `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` (**regenerated**, +11 lines, nothing else), `sim/ooc_gdnadapt.tcl` (env hooks `GDNADAPT_RECUR_LANES` / `GDNADAPT_CONST_HBM`, object-level census, second WNS read), `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-check-was-one-declaration-class-too-narrow.md`, this entry. **No hardware. No Vivado on the workstation** (its lane held by a `FK33_CARD=1` route); all four arms on the BC-250.
- **PART 1, ANSWER: NO, IT DID NOT.** MEASURED, 23 s into the first run: `ERROR: [Synth 8-36] 'bst_const_base' is not declared [rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd:677]`. `bst_const_base` is a **PORT** of `llama_top` (`:972`), added by the **same 2026-09-18 commit** as the `B_CONST_HBM` generic IPSYNC had just repaired. IPSYNC's new `undeclared_generics()` excludes ports by construction (`(?!in\b|out\b|inout\b)`), so it **went green over a file that does not compile, which is the exact failure it was written to prevent**. Its docstring said so honestly -- *"it sees undeclared GENERICS only"* -- and **the stated limit was the bug**. The mechanism is not "generics are hardcoded", it is "the PROLOGUE is a hardcoded template", and the prologue hardcodes the generic clause **and the port list**.
- **AFTER THE GENERATOR FIX: `grep -cE '^ERROR'` = 0, `synth_design` completes, all four arms rc=0.** Fixed the generator, not the generated file (line 2 says DO NOT EDIT); `git diff` on the output is **11 insertions, 0 deletions**, all the new port and its comment. `gdnstale` stays green.
- **TEETH, WITH THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL.** old check / old output: **NOTHING** (the defect, missed). NEW / old: **`['bst_const_base']`**. NEW / new: NOTHING. **old / new: NOTHING** -- the old check cannot discriminate in either direction, so the kill is attributable entirely to the new port half. Plus `B_CONST_HBM` deleted -> caught (old half intact) and `bst_state_base` deleted -> caught (port half generalises).
- **MEASURED AND REJECTED: widening to ports WITHOUT stripping port-map formals.** First widened version reported **four** names; three (`busy`, `err`, `seq_rst`) appear only as FORMALS (`busy => b_busy` at `:522`), which name the instantiated entity's ports and have nothing to do with `llama_top`'s. Had it shipped it would have cried wolf every run and the rational response is to narrow it again, back through the hole.
- **THE CONFIGURATION FINDING, AND IT RETRO-DISCOUNTS THIS HARNESS'S OLD NUMBERS.** `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py:149,171` passes `B_STATE_AXI=true` and `B_CONST_HBM=true`; `sim/ooc_gdnadapt.tcl` defaulted **both false**. `B_STATE_AXI` picks between mutually exclusive generates (`gen_st_flat:565` / `gen_st_tier:602`), so **every default-arm figure from this harness measures the arm the card does not build.** At lanes=4: flat **133,591 LUT / 5,472 RAMB36 / 0 URAM**, tier **70,815 LUT / 33 RAMB36 / 32 URAM**. The flat arm reproduces the recorded **5,472 RAMB36** and the recorded **WNS -4.008** to the digit -- a good control that the harness behaves, and the tell that those recorded numbers are flat-arm figures.
- **PART 2, THE CARD-MATCHING PAIR** (`B_STATE_AXI=true B_CONST_HBM=true`, same tree `864bb31e`, `GDNADAPT_CONFIG` differing in exactly one field):

  | | lanes=4 | lanes=16 | delta |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | CLB LUTs | 70,815 | 78,503 | **+7,688** |
  | LUT as Logic | 54,834 | 62,492 | +7,658 |
  | LUT as Memory | 15,981 | 16,011 | +30 |
  | CLB Registers | 42,987 | 50,987 | **+8,000** |
  | CARRY8 | 1,721 | 2,309 | +588 |
  | F7 / F8 Muxes | 4,547 / 848 | 4,785 / 863 | +238 / +15 |
  | RAMB36 | 33 | 42 | **+9** |
  | RAMB18 / URAM | 126 / 32 | 126 / 32 | **0 / 0** |
  | DSPs | 171 | 219 | **+48** |
  | core WNS | -4.008 | -4.008 | 0.000 |

- **AND THE FLAT PAIR, WHERE THE LUT DELTA HAS THE OPPOSITE SIGN:** 133,591 -> 126,046 = **-7,545 LUT**, FF 47,271 -> 65,595 = **+18,324**, RAMB36 **5,472 -> 5,472 (0)**, DSP 191 -> 239 = **+48**, CARRY8 1,814 -> 2,402 = **+588**.
- **SO: DSP +48 AND CARRY8 +588 ARE INVARIANT ACROSS BOTH CONFIGURATIONS, EXACTLY; THE LUT DELTA IS NOT EVEN INVARIANT IN SIGN.** LEVERCOST's `gdn_block` figures (+7,742 LUT, +8,054 FF, +48 DSP, +9 BRAM) agree closely with the **tier** pair (+7,688 / +8,000 / +48 / +9; LUT 0.70% apart, FF 0.67% apart) and not at all with the flat one. **The delta transfers a second level of nesting up AND into a different state configuration -- but only the card's configuration, and that is a fact that had to be measured rather than assumed.**
- **PRE-REGISTERED AND CONFIRMED:** the flat state array is `NLY*STLY` words of `RL*16` bits with `NBR = DM/RL`, so its total bits are **independent of `B_RECUR_LANES`** (the file's own comment: *"the lane count cancels"*). Predicted before the run: a BRAM delta in the flat arm is packing, not capacity, sign unpredicted. MEASURED: **RAMB36 5,472 in both flat arms, delta exactly 0.**
- **THE WNS IN THIS HARNESS MEASURES NOTHING ABOUT THIS LEVER, AND MUST NOT BE QUOTED AS IF IT DID.** `-4.008` is **identical to three decimals in all four arms**, across a 63,000-LUT and 166x-RAMB36 difference. Two independent extractions agree, so it is a real property of each netlist -- it is simply pinned by a path common to every configuration. **A metric that does not move when the design changes that much has no demonstrated resolution on the thing under test.** Compounding it: `create_clock` runs AFTER `synth_design` in this script, so synthesis was never timing-driven, and nothing places or routes.
- **WHAT THIS PAIR DOES AND DOES NOT LICENSE.** It gives the card-configuration AREA cost of the lever, which did not exist before and which LEVERCOST could only get at one level down in a different state arm. It does **not** license `B_RECUR_LANES=16` into build 12: MEASURED, the transitive RTL closure of the B mover is 18 entities (`gdn_block gdn_conv gdn_conv_tap_mem gdn_conv_w_mem gdn_emit_chain gdn_exp_capture gdn_exp_mem gdn_head_emit gdn_job_seq gdn_recur_pipe gdn_scalar gdn_silu gdn_state_axi gdn_state_mem gdn_state_store gdn_y_emit l2norm_rs rmsnorm_bf`) and **none of them contains `FAST_POP`, `SWEEP_PIPE` or `SCORE_EARLY`** -- build 11's three levers live in A's read path (`stream_fifo`/`async_fifo`/`axi_rd_port`/`matvec_int4_desc_axi`) and in `attn_block`. So the composition risk really is PLACEMENT and congestion, not synthesis, and **an OOC pair cannot answer a placement question.** What WOULD license it is a routed `FK33_CARD=1` build with `B_RECUR_LANES=16` against one with 4, same tree, same directives, reading the CORE-clock row.
- **MEASUREMENT TRAP HIT, CAUGHT BEFORE IT WAS QUOTED.** The first flat pair was **not one-variable**: its lanes=4 point ran on remote tree `5b6019f4`, its lanes=16 point on `864bb31e`. Both differences are arguable as inert and the argument is not the point. The lanes=4 point was **re-run on the current tree**, and reproduced the old run **to the digit** on every row -- so the tree difference is now measured inert rather than assumed. The tier pair never had the problem.
- **SECOND TRAP: `REF_NAME =~ DSP*` OVER-COUNTS BY EXACTLY 9x.** Census said **1,719** against a utilization row of **191**, because after synthesis a DSP is a hierarchy of sub-primitives (`DSP_ALU`, `DSP_MULTIPLIER`, `DSP_M_DATA`, `DSP_PREADD`, `DSP_OUTPUT`...) and every one matches `DSP*`. This file already warns that `PRIMITIVE_GROUP == DSP` matches NOTHING; the general lesson is that **a census is authoritative only when its FILTER is right, and a filter can be wrong in either direction.** Script now prints `DSP48*` and `DSP*` side by side so the ratio stays visible.
- **MEMORY: EVERY ARM HIT THE CAP, SO NO `memory.peak` HERE IS AN APPETITE.** Under `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryHigh=10G`, `memory.current` pinned at 10 GiB in all four. Sampled (current, swap) maxima: flat4 **10,737,295,360 / 6,287,208,448**, flat16 **10,737,385,472 / 4,757,680,128**, tier4 **10,737,217,536 / 1,930,477,568**, tier16 **10,737,328,128 / 1,903,890,432**. **DERIVED true footprint: at least ~17.0 GB for the flat arm and ~12.7 GB for the tier arm; the actual peaks are UNKNOWN.** The cap was not raised: a `MemoryHigh=12G` run on that box once left it completely unreachable, and it is on no WoL watchdog. Wall times 12m03s / 14m21s / 5m57s / 9m04s; box never below 171 MB free with 48 GB of swap and PSI under 4%.
- **SYNC:** 114 `rtl/*.vhd` blobs from `git show HEAD:<path>` at **`fc6472a`** plus the regenerated `ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` and the two `sim/ooc_gdnadapt*` files, rsynced into a **standalone remote root** (`/home/labuser/gdnsynth/tree`), manifest sha256 verified **identical on both boxes** before every launch. GSRWIDE's and SCOREHDR's in-flight edits to `rtl/llama_top.vhd` and `rtl/attn_block.vhd` did **not** travel. (`gb_real`'s body is byte-identical between HEAD and the working tree, confirmed by `--check` rc=0 on both.)
- **OPEN, NOT DETERMINED:** the enclosing-scope SIGNAL class is still uncovered by the widened check (the obvious fourth instance), as are types, architecture constants, and every non-undeclared-name failure; there is still **no compile step** in the gate, because `gdn_block` and `gdn_state_store` do not analyse under GHDL; whether `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_ss_top.vhd` carries the same hole (frozen, not examined); **why the LUT delta inverts sign between the two state arms** (measured, not explained); what the `-4.008` path actually is (never reported -- no checkpoint was saved); and the whole placement question, which only a routed card build answers.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK SCOREHDR: the header pass was serial for TWO different reasons and neither was a hardware one; a one-level-per-cycle tree takes it 16 cycles -> 5 and the slope 355.17 -> 311.17

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/attn_score_q12.vhd` (new generic `HDR_TREE`, 0 = the legacy scan and the default), `rtl/attn_block.vhd` (**two hunks only**: one pass-through generic `SCORE_HDR_TREE` and one line in `u_sq`'s generic map), `sim/tb_attn_score_q12.vhd` and `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd` (a pass-through generic each), pass-through generic added to `sim/tb_attn_block.vhd` and `sim/tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd`, new `sim/mutate_attn_score_hdr.sh`. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` and `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` NOT edited.** No hardware. **No Vivado** (workstation lane on a card build, BC-250 on TRACK LEVERCOST), so AREA is an ESTIMATE from the structure and TIMING is a judgement. Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-score-header-pass.md`.
- **THE CLASSIFICATION THE BRIEF ASKED FOR, AND THE TWO STATES GIVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS.** `S_EMIN` (`attn_score_q12.vhd:420`, NBLK-1 = 7 cycles) has a **genuine loop-carried dependency AS WRITTEN** -- `e_min` is the accumulator and an operand of the next compare -- **but `min` is associative and commutative, so the dependency is a property of the spelling, not of the function.** `S_SHIFTS` (`:513`, NBLK = 8 cycles) has **NO dependency at all**: the subtracts share only `e_min`, already final on entry. **It is simply a loop written serially.** Neither is a shared comparator or subtractor: `EXP_W = 8`, so a whole level is four 8-bit compares. `NBLK = HEAD_DIM/KV_BLOCK = 256/32 = 8`; from the accept edge to `p_rdy` is `2*NBLK = 16` cycles.
- **MEASURED, `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd`, 9B geometry, slope per position per C job, eleven arms.** The four `HDR_TREE=0` arms reproduce MIDGAP's 35517 / 32317 / 27511 / 23117 **to the digit**. `SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` alone **355.17 -> 311.17 (-44.00)**, `sc_wait` 14.00 -> 3.00. With `SWEEP_PIPE` **231.11**; with `SWEEP_PIPE`+`SCORE_EARLY` **219.87 (-135.30, -38.1%)** and `sc_wait` **0.00**.
- **IT IS SUB-ADDITIVE WITH `SCORE_EARLY` AND ADDITIVE WITH `SWEEP_PIPE`, AND BOTH FACTS ARE MEASUREMENTS.** 44.00 + 32.00 = 76.00 against a measured **64.00** -- the two attack the same 14 cycles from opposite ends, one moving the pass earlier and one shortening it. But 80.06 + 44.00 = 124.06 and the measured `SWEEP_PIPE` pair is **124.06**, exact. **MIDGAP's pair was SUPER-additive; this one is SUB-additive; the rule that generalises is "measure the combination", not the sign.**
- **`SWEEP_PIPE`+`SCORE_HDR_TREE=1` (231.11) EQUALS `SWEEP_PIPE`+`SCORE_EARLY` (231.17).** They are interchangeable, and this is the smaller change -- one generic inside one leaf unit against new state and a new assert in the sweep FSM.
- **SET IT TO 1, NOT 2 OR 3, AND THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN CAUTIOUS.** On the all-three arm `HDR_TREE` 1, 2 and 3 all return `CSWEEP_SLOPE_X100 21987`, identical to the digit, because the pass is already fully hidden. `HDR_TREE=1` costs **one compare + mux per cycle, exactly what the legacy scan already costs**; 2 and 3 put two or three in series on a design routed at WNS **+0.061 ns** for zero cycles.
- **THE CYCLE COUNT IS A CLOSED FORM, EXACT AT TWENTY POINTS, NOT A FIT.** `1 + ceil(clog2(NBLK)/L) + 1` against the legacy `2*NBLK`, tested at `NBLK` 3/5/6/7/8 x `HDR_TREE` 0/1/2/3 on `tb_attn_score_q12` with vectors regenerated per NBLK: **20 of 20 exact, and all 20 PASS the value oracle.**
- **VALUES BIT-IDENTICAL IN TWENTY RUNS against two independent C oracles.** `tb_attn_block` vs `ref/attn_block_vec.c`: **all ten verdict strings BYTE-IDENTICAL** (130 compared values). `tb_attn_kv_seam` vs `ref/attn_block_seq_vec.c`: identical but for `longest quiet stretch` (2137 at ht0, 2133 at ht1, 2132 at ht3), i.e. 2056 output values and 2176 record bytes in HBM bit-exact in every arm. The four `ht0` wall times reproduce MIDGAP's to the NANOSECOND across an edit to both files, which is the control that says the generic is genuinely off by default.
- **TEETH: 23 rows, 5 KILLED, 17 SURVIVED, 1 BADMUT, attribution control (`HDR_TREE=0`) on every row, PLUS a ten-seed sweep on every survivor.** `T1` (compare reversed), `T4` (subtracts rotated one block), `T3` and `T5` at NBLK 5 are four clean attributed kills. **`T8` is the POSITIVE CONTROL on the OFF column** -- removing `S_IDLE`'s `e_min` seed is inert under the tree and KILLS under the legacy scan, which is the only reason thirteen OFF-column PASSes mean anything.
- **TWO ROWS AT NBLK 8 ARE UNREACHABLE AND ARE REPORTED AS SUCH.** The odd-level carry cannot execute at any power-of-two NBLK, so `T3`/`T5` at the card geometry measure NOTHING; both are re-run at `NBLK = 5` with regenerated vectors and both KILL. Quoting the NBLK 8 row alone would have been an unreachable mutant reported as a resolution floor.
- **`T2` SURVIVES THE COMMITTED GOLDEN AND DIES AT 5 OF 10 OFF-GOLDEN SEEDS.** Dropping a leaf from the reduction is **nearly** value-neutral because `e_min` is a common scale that cancels in the Q12 conversion -- **confirmed by a third path**, an independent Python model that reproduces all 64 golden values and finds 0 of 64 changed. Nearly, not exactly: the flooring residual is real and the seed sweep finds it. **A mutant that survives one golden has not been shown to be inert.**
- **`T6` DID NOT BITE IN 22 RUNS AND THAT IS A FINDING.** Raising `p_ready` one state early is value-neutral **because of the CONSUMER's latency** (`attn_block.vhd:1004` combinational, `:1951` clocked, `attn_mac_array.vhd:455` registers `pv_r`), not because of this unit's structure. The unit's stated contract currently holds on a timing relationship nobody had written down. RTL unchanged; recorded.
- **MY OWN MUTATION HARNESS HAD THE DEFECT IT EXISTS TO FIND.** A shell-quoting mistake made `T2`'s anchor match 0 times; `mutate_rtl` echoed `""`, `run_case` read that as "use the repo file", and **the PRISTINE design was run and reported SURVIVED, then swept over ten seeds as `0/10`.** Fixed with an `__ANCHOR_FAIL__` sentinel and a **BADMUT** verdict counted apart from a survival, plus row **`Z0`** -- a deliberately impossible anchor whose only correct outcome is BADMUT, so the harness has teeth of its own. **`sim/mutate_attn_score_early.sh` and its siblings carry the same `echo ""`** and have NOT been audited.
- **GATE, five groups, all GREEN inside md5 windows that MATCHED**: `tb_attn` **PASS 16 / NOCHECK 1 / SKIPPED 4** (standing shape, unchanged), `tb_csweep_rate` **PASS 1**, `seamgate` **PASS 6**, `tb_llama_top_kv` **PASS 1**, `kvmap` **PASS 1**, FAIL 0 everywhere. **THE FIRST FIVE-GROUP RUN WAS VOIDED BY THIS TRACK'S OWN COMMENT-ONLY EDIT** to `rtl/attn_block.vhd` mid-window; the guard named both files and both hashes. All five were re-run against the final bytes.
- **NEXT, and it is ONE job for all three generics, not three:** `SWEEP_PIPE`, `SCORE_EARLY` and `SCORE_HDR_TREE` are all **zero occurrences** in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, `tools/gen_cardtop.py` and `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`, so setting any of them in a build today is **silently ignored** (TRACK LEVERCOST's finding, confirmed here for the new one). Plumb all three, then at the `u_attn : entity work.attn_block` instance (`rtl/llama_top.vhd:6914` today -- **find it by name, MIDGAP's `:6621` is already stale**) add `SWEEP_PIPE => true, SCORE_EARLY => true, SCORE_HDR_TREE => 1`. DERIVED on the card: token slope **2,793.4 -> 1,729.3**, tok/s **+6.5%** at 2,048, **+19.7%** at 8,192, **+48.6%** at 65,536; intercept unmoved.
- **OPEN, and the first still gates a build:** AREA and TIMING are **UNMEASURED**. ESTIMATE **+130 to +200 LUT and +34 FF per score unit, x4 in `attn_block`** = +520 to +800 LUT, i.e. **0.7-1.0% of the card's 76,585 free LUT sites** -- an order of magnitude more than `SWEEP_PIPE`'s measured +64 and an order less than `B_RECUR_LANES=16`'s +7,742. **It is NOT free.** What settles it: two arms on `sim/ooc_levercost_run.sh`'s existing `attn_block` draw for AREA -- **but that harness has `route_design` count ZERO**, and unlike `SWEEP_PIPE` this lever's entire cost IS combinational depth, so TIMING needs place+route plus a `report_timing -through` on the score cone (LEVERCOST recorded that none of its top 200 paths is in this block's FSM). Also open: folding level 0 inside `S_IDLE` would remove the 64-bit source mux and one more cycle at the same depth and was deliberately NOT built; the odd-level carry is unreachable in every shipping geometry and is carried code; no run above RD_LAT 100; no `cardtop` row with any of the three generics on; and the sub-additivity with `SCORE_EARLY` is measured at ONE stimulus.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK IPSYNC: the stale package was real and is fixed; the attribution control says NOTHING ELSE IN THE TREE CATCHES IT; and `ooc_gdnadapt_top` was green over a file that does not compile

- **Files owned and changed:** `ip_repo/llama_engine_axi_1_0/component.xml`, `ip_repo/llama_engine_axi_1_0/src/llama_engine_axi.vhd` (`ed3b0d8`); `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py`, `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` (`de77c9a`); new `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-packaged-ip-went-stale.md`. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` NOT touched** (GSRWIDE owns it). No hardware. **No Vivado on the workstation** -- its lane was on the `FK33_CARD=1` `route_design`; the packaging ran on the BC-250.
- **THE DIAGNOSIS IS CONFIRMED BY BLOB IDENTITY, NOT BY BYTE COUNTS.** `rtl/` and `ip_repo/` are the SAME git object `ac8d35c7` at `cb2600f`; `09f68a0` moves `rtl/` to `f88381a0` and the packaged copy stays at `ac8d35c7` through HEAD. `git log cb2600f..HEAD -- rtl/llama_engine_axi.vhd` returns **exactly one commit**. The delta is only `09f68a0`'s `prompt_len_i` rewire, in the `rtl/` direction, so it is a stale package and **not** an intended divergence. **1 of 32 packaged `.vhd` differs**, so the other two IPs are in sync and were deliberately left alone.
- **RE-PACKAGED ON THE BC-250: 0 ERROR, `PACKAGE_DONE` anchored count 1, `check_integrity` passed, all three bus interfaces re-inferred.** The single `CRITICAL WARNING` is `[IP_Flow 19-5655]` VHDL-2008 top, which is structural and deliberate (the script's own header says so). **Peak 1,321 MB against `MemoryHigh=10G`, swap flat at 823 MB, so THE CAP WAS NEVER REACHED and this is an honest peak rather than the cap.**
- **`sim:ipsync`: pre-fix `OVERALL PASS 0 FAIL 1` (`NOT GREEN: sim:ipsync`), post-fix `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0 REGRESSION: PASS`.** `sim/regress.sh` md5 `91f5619a` identical at both ends of that window, so nothing edited the runner mid-run. `sim:gdnstale` also PASS.
- **THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL, AND THE HONEST ANSWER IS "NOTHING ELSE".** `ghdl`/analyze lines naming `ip_repo` = **0**; gate-row commands naming `ip_repo` excluding `ipsync` itself = **0**. GATEDAY's "the gate stayed green over it for a day" is not a coverage gap that has since closed -- **it is the structural situation, and the `ipsync` row is the entire defence.** (The first count came back `1`, which was the `ipsync` row matching itself: the self-match trap in miniature.)
- **THE SYNC WAS NOT RUN, AND THAT WAS THE POINT.** All **27** packager inputs are clean at HEAD and **none of the five dirty `rtl/` files** (`attn_block`, `attn_score_q12`, `fk33_llama_top`, `llama_top`, `swiglu_mem` -- GSRWIDE and SCOREHDR) is a packager input. They were rsynced into a **standalone remote root**, possible only because PATHFREE made the packager derive its root from `info script`. So no in-flight edit could travel, and LEVERCOST's committed-copy `attn_block.vhd` on that box was not clobbered. `INPUTS_IDENTICAL_ACROSS_BOXES` on 28 md5s before the run.
- **ONE NON-METADATA DIFFERENCE CAME BACK AND IS NOT ROOT-CAUSED.** The BC-250-packaged `component.xml` lists **23 supportedFamilies to the workstation's 24, dropping `versal`**. Both boxes are Vivado **2023.2** and both carry all **29** device-family directories, so it is neither a version nor a partial-install difference. It does not touch the RTL, the interfaces or the port set, and **`virtexuplusHBM` -- the FK33's own family -- is absent from BOTH lists**, so the target is unaffected. **Recorded because CLAUDE.md's "bit-identical across the two machines" was established for OOC synthesis and a full bitstream; it does NOT extend to IP-XACT packaging metadata, and this is the counter-example.**
- **SECOND ITEM, AND IT IS THE MORE INTERESTING ONE: `sim:gdnstale` PASSED GREEN OVER A FILE THAT DOES NOT COMPILE.** `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` used `B_CONST_HBM` at six sites and declared it nowhere, because the extraction copies `gb_real`'s BODY verbatim while its generic clause is a **hardcoded template** in `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py`. **`--check` regenerates and DIFFS TEXT, and the generator faithfully reproduced the same broken output it had written before -- a round trip, not an oracle.** A scan of all 61 `llama_top` generics found **exactly one** used-but-undeclared name.
- **IT IS THE SAME DEFECT TWICE.** The template already carries a "SEAM REPAIR 2026-09-05" note for `B_STATE_AXI`, hand-patched after `5f1db1a` did exactly this. So it is a recurring class, and the fix is a gate rather than a third hand-patch.
- **THE GATE WENT IN `emit()`, NOT IN `regress.sh`.** `undeclared_generics()` checks generic closure with no compiler, from the one choke point **both** the write path and `--check` pass through, so **the existing `sim:gdnstale` row gained the teeth with `sim/regress.sh` untouched** -- which also meant no edit to a shared runner while other gates may be live. The generator now REFUSES to write a file that cannot compile rather than reporting it afterwards.
- **TEETH AND ATTRIBUTION, on the true historical tree (generator AND output both from HEAD): new check ABSENT -> `GDNADAPT_CHECK ok`, rc=0; new check PRESENT -> `GENERIC NOT CARRIED ... B_CONST_HBM`, rc=1. CHECK ALONE.** GHDL, same minimal library both sides with the 3 `unit not found` harness messages IDENTICAL on each side: pre-fix **5** `no declaration for "b_const_hbm"` plus a derived `bad attribute parameter`; post-fix **0**, and 0 other messages.
- **A COMPILE STEP FOR `sim:gdnstale` IS DEFERRED, NOT REFUTED.** MEASURED: `gdn_block` and `gdn_state_store` do **not** analyse under this box's GHDL 1.0 (rc=1 each; a fixpoint pass over `rtl/*.vhd` reaches **94 of 112** and stalls), so the row could not be made green today. The BC-250 now has GHDL 6.0.0 and is the obvious place to settle it. `undeclared_generics()` is explicitly narrower and says so.
- **TRAPS HIT, all mine, all written up:** the attribution control fired STALE **for the wrong reason twice** before it was readable -- running the mutant generator from scratch made `emit()`'s relpath normalisation derive the wrong repo root from `__file__`, embedding `../../../../home/orencollaco/...` in the header, **which is the trap `emit()` already documents, met from a direction its comment did not anticipate** (it was written about the caller's cwd, and it bites equally on the script's own location); the first mutant was confounded by my own 14-line comment left in the template, so it was rebuilt from `git show HEAD:`; and `md5sum ... | tee f | head -3` SIGPIPE'd `md5sum` and recorded **3 of 28** hashes while looking complete.
- **OPEN:** the `versal` metadata difference (unexplained); whether `mac_axi_1_0` and `matvec_engine_1_0` would survive a repackage (untested, deliberately not run); a real compile step for `gdnstale`; whether `ooc_gdnadapt_top` now SYNTHESISES (only the known error is gone -- no Vivado was run against it, so LEVERCOST's harness is unblocked but not shown to complete); and how long `ip_repo/` was unguarded before the `ipsync` row existed.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK LEVERCOST: the card-top A/B the four levers need CANNOT BE RUN; `FAST_POP` is +1 LUT, `SWEEP_PIPE` is +64 LUT and exactly +23 FF, and `B_RECUR_LANES=16` is +7,742 LUT

- **Files owned and added:** new `sim/ooc_levercost.tcl`, `sim/ooc_levercost_run.sh`, `sim/ooc_levercost_timing.tcl`, new `hw/fk33/results/levercost_2026-09-20/`. **No RTL changed, no generator changed.** No hardware. **No Vivado on the workstation** -- its lane was on build10's `impl_1` throughout; all nine draws ran on the BC-250.
- **THE BRIEF ASKED FOR AN OOC OF `fk33_llama_top` AT 9B IN FIVE ARMS. THAT JOB HAS NEVER TERMINATED ONCE.** `hw/fk33/ooc_c_in_card.tcl` records `grep -c 'Finished RTL Elaboration'` = **ZERO across twelve attempts on two machines**; `hw/fk33/ooc_card_dcp.tcl` records the best of them at **47 h under `MemoryHigh=24G`** wanting **at least 39.1 GiB** and still not finishing. So each lever was drawn in **the smallest entity that closes its cone** -- and two of the four have none.
- **`FAST_POP`: +1 LUT, 0 FF, 0 DSP, 0 BRAM, and NO measurable timing cost.** Drawn on `matvec_int4_desc_axi` at the card's 27-lane geometry, the entity that **closes the cone TRACK AIDLE left open** (`pop_w <= all_v and w_ready` fans to all 27 read enables; `w_ready` carries `xq_cnt > 0` from `matvec_core`; both are inside it). CLB LUTs **136,919 -> 136,920**. The census gives AIDLE's mechanism one scope up: **LUT4 -27, LUT5 +29**, one per read port. Timing: intra-clock WNS **9.088 / 1.103 unchanged**, and because an unchanged WNS alone is only a bound, both post-opt DCPs were reopened and the **top 200 intra-domain paths per clock dumped: md5-IDENTICAL on both clocks**, and **92 of those 200 run from the FIFO's `ocnt_reg` to the MAC array's DSP `CEA2` enables -- the lever's own cone -- unchanged.** The `m_aclk` 1.103 reproduces AIDLE's figure on AIDLE's named path.
- **`SWEEP_PIPE`: +64 LUT and EXACTLY +23 FF, 0 DSP, 0 BRAM, WNS unchanged.** Drawn on `attn_block` from **HEAD's committed copy** (`bc4156f`, md5 verified on the box), not the working tree. **TRACK CSWEEP's pre-registered ESTIMATE was "~23 FF plus a 4-bit mux" -- the flip-flop count is 23, exactly.** Top-200 path lists md5-identical; but **none of the top 200 is in the sweep FSM**, so for C this is a bound (> 9.540 ns of slack) rather than the direct evidence A got.
- **`B_RECUR_LANES=16`: +7,742 LUT, +8,054 FF, +48 DSP, +9 BRAM, WNS unchanged**, measured on `gdn_block` -- the context BRECUR listed as its first open item. **The pipe-level delta transfers almost exactly one level up: DSP +48 and BRAM +9 EXACT, LUT +7,865 vs +7,742 (1.6%).** That is this project's "parts do not sum across contexts" rule being tested across one level of nesting and coming out favourably; it is **not** a claim about the card.
- **`A_DRAIN_WIDE` CANNOT BE MEASURED BY ANY OOC DRAW THAT EXISTS.** Its logic is in the **architecture body** of `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` (`wgmux` :1518, guard :1803, traversal :4665/:5147), inside `ga_desc`, which is **not an entity**. `docs/2026-09-20_d-side-vector-traffic.md:1007` asks for this on "whichever Vivado lane is free"; **the free lane was never the obstacle.** Its +250..400 LUT / +156 FF stays ESTIMATE. The mux is `LANES*MANT_W = 128` bits with `LANES` a generic the card leaves at 8, so it does **not** scale with the model -- which is what makes the reduced-`C_MAXPOS` card-top draw in the write-up's section 8 worth one **time-boxed** attempt.
- **ENABLING `SWEEP_PIPE` IN THE BUILD TODAY WOULD BE SILENTLY IGNORED.** At HEAD the generic appears **24 times in `rtl/attn_block.vhd` and ZERO times** in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, `tools/gen_cardtop.py` and `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`. `fk33_engine.vhd` states the rule (*"`-generic` reaches the TOP's generics only, never a deep instance"*) and `gen_fk33_card.py` records that *"`tools/gen_bd_wrapper.py` emits generics VERBATIM and checks nothing against the entity"*. **Plumb it through `llama_top` and `gen_cardtop.py` first.**
- **RECOMMENDATION FOR BUILD 11: `FAST_POP` alone** (one line, `gen_fk33_engine.py:113` `FAST_POP_DEFAULT = False -> True`), **`SWEEP_PIPE` beside or just after it once plumbed** (+65 LUT for the pair, **0.085% of the free LUT sites**, and they sit in different BD cells so a WNS regression stays attributable), and **`B_RECUR_LANES=16` LAST and ALONE** -- it is **10.1% of the free LUT sites against the others' 0.08%**, and it is the one lever whose failure mode is a build that does not close. Read the **CORE-clock** row of the result, never the global WNS, which lives in the AXI domain and will not move.
- **THE BINDING CONSTRAINT IS NOT LUT CAPACITY.** DERIVED from the placed report: **76,585 LUT sites are free** (75,737 inside already-occupied CLBs, 848 in the 106 free ones), so on capacity arithmetic even +76,585 LUT "fits". What does not is the placement -- the build uses `Congestion_SpreadLogic_high`, whose purpose is to **spread** logic, and every added LUT must pack denser against it. **Build 11's fit question is congestion and timing, not capacity, and no OOC number answers it.**
- **`[Synth 8-7186]` RECONCILED, AND VIVADO IS FLATLY WRONG.** Both brecur arms reported 101 -- which is the **message LIMIT plus its own notice**. Re-drawn with the limit raised: **1,024 real warnings** saying `ram_style="distributed"` was ignored for `qbuf`, against a named census of **`RAMD32` 4,290 + `RAMS32` 614 + `RAM32M16` 306 + `RAM32M` 1 = 5,211 distributed-RAM primitives and ZERO flip-flops.** The recorded "it denies a resource the design DID get" case, with fresh evidence. `[Synth 8-10226]` is 0 everywhere.
- **A REAL BREAKAGE FOUND ON THE WAY:** `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` **does not compile at HEAD** -- it uses `B_CONST_HBM` at `:377/:604/:782/:843/:869/:903` and never declares it, stale since 2026-09-18. `read_vhdl` accepts it silently and `synth_design` then dies with 7 errors, which is how it killed this track's first run from a file the target cannot reach. **Nothing schedules that harness.**
- **TRAPS HIT, all this track's own, all written up:** a bash waiter run through the BC-250's **fish** printed `REMOTE_RUN_FINISHED` instantly after `fish: Unknown command: until`; two `create_clock`s without `set_clock_groups -asynchronous` made **every** reported path a CDC crossing (a 0.376 ns datapath reported at 0.939 ns slack on a 13.333 ns clock -- the arithmetic is the tell); the fix for the parser bug that followed (`get_clocks -- $nm`) **failed identically** because `get_clocks` rejects `--` too; an unanchored `grep -c 'Synth 8-10226'` counted **this script's own `set_msg_config` line** echoed into the log, reporting 1 occurrence of a message that never happened; and the inherited LUTRAM census filter **under-counted by 4x** because `RAM32*`/`RAM64*` miss `RAMD32`/`RAMS32`, which were 94% of the array.
- **WHAT MADE THE BUGS CHEAP: `write_checkpoint`.** Four draws died at a constraint step that runs AFTER synthesis, opt, both censuses and every `report_*`. **No measurement was lost** -- only the CSV and the path dump -- and re-opening the DCPs to redo the timing took **~2 min per netlist against ~12 to re-synthesise**. A failure signal after the work is done does not invalidate the work.
- **OPEN:** `FAST_POP`'s **routed** cost (closed at OOC level, open on the card); `SWEEP_PIPE`'s own cone needs a `report_timing -through`, not a top-N window; `A_DRAIN_WIDE` unsynthesised in any form; **no current per-subsystem area figure for the card exists in the tree at all** -- `bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt` was written without `-hierarchical` (`grep -c Instance` = 0), and adding that flag to the card build is a one-line fix that would make every future comparison same-tree; and whether the three constant levers' cycle savings are additive (assumed, not measured -- do not quote the 1.26x).

### 2026-09-20 TRACK MIDGAP: MIDGAP is 26 cycles of softmax-and-drain and 14 of `attn_score_q12` walking its own header; `SCORE_EARLY` composes with `SWEEP_PIPE` for **-34.9%**

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/attn_block.vhd` (new generic `SCORE_EARLY`, OFF by default; two debug OUT ports `dbg_sw_ph` / `dbg_sw_aux`, unassociated at every instantiation in the tree), `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd` (the split instrument), new `sim/mutate_attn_score_early.sh`, pass-through generic added to `sim/tb_attn_block.vhd` and `sim/tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd`. **`rtl/llama_top.vhd` and `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` NOT edited.** No hardware. **No Vivado** (workstation lane on a card build, BC-250 on TRACK LEVERCOST), so every AREA and TIMING claim is ABSENT rather than estimated. Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-attention-midgap.md`.
- **THE SPLIT, MEASURED not derived, and the derivation lost 14 cycles.** CSWEEP's open item said "~40 of MIDGAP's 56.42 are the score drain plus softmax". **It is 26.00.** MEASURED per position per KV head, asymptotic slope, real 9B geometry: `P_RECK 12.79 | P_HDR 3.00 | P_SCORE 23.00 | P_SCW 13.00 | P_EPW 13.00 | rescale 0.00 | P_RECV 11.00 | P_PV 9.00 | P_POSN 4.00 = 88.79`, x4 = 355.17. **P_SCORE's 23.00 is 14.00 cycles waiting for `ar_prdy` and 9.00 issuing** -- the derivation had counted it as 8 countable issues. Those 14 are `attn_score_q12`'s S_EMIN + S_SHIFTS (`:343`, `:357`), `2*NBLK - 1` serial cycles over the K header, during which the sweep does nothing. `P_SCW` and `P_EPW` are fixed pipeline latencies; **nothing in the sweep is a divide** -- `attn_recip` runs once per query head after the sweep and contributes 0.00 to the slope, proved by a sum identity, not by argument.
- **THE OVERLAP CSWEEP NAMED IS LEGAL AND IS BLOCKED BY THE SCHEDULE, NOT BY A DEPENDENCY.** `score(p+1)` reads `qrec`, `krec`, `khdr` and NO softmax state, so it is numerically independent of `softmax(p)`. It is blocked by (i) `krec` not holding p+1 yet even under `SWEEP_PIPE`, through a capture path ONE pipe wide (`rbv`/`rbs`), and (ii) `attn_mac_array` having ONE multiplier and three exclusive modes (`:339`), which P_PV needs for 9 cycles straight after P_EPW's 13. The full lever is a depth-2 software pipeline with a 3-deep record queue; **NOT BUILT**.
- **WHAT WAS BUILT is the part that needs neither: `SCORE_EARLY`, OFF by default.** The header is complete on the record's FIRST beat and the header pass touches no multiplier, so it is hoisted on its own. MEASURED, cycles per position per C job: base **355.17**; `SWEEP_PIPE` **275.11**; `SCORE_EARLY` **323.17**; **both 231.17 (-34.9%)**. **THE TWO ARE SUPERADDITIVE: 80.06 + 32.00 = 112.06 against a measured 124.00.** With `SWEEP_PIPE` on, the next K header lands during P_PV, so the hand-over is a whole P_PV and P_POSN earlier and hides 8.99 of the 14.00 instead of 6.00. **Quote the pair; never add the singles.**
- **CORRECTION TO CSWEEP: "the KV cache contributes ZERO cycles" is WITHDRAWN.** MEASURED with the same `IDEAL_CACHE` control read through the new instrument: the cache costs **7.17 cycles per position per C job** at RD_LAT 100 (355.17 against an ideal 348.00), of which 6.35 is read latency and 0.82 is the residency answer. All of it is `rk_pre`, the wait for the FIRST K beat, which `krdy_low` is structurally unable to see because it counts only once a record has started. **The headline is not overturned** -- 7.17 is 2.0% against the 84% on the score chain, and widening the port / burst / MAXOUT / RBUF all stay REJECTED. Also corrected: that document's "the endpoint slope differs by 0.7 cycles per position (348.00 against 355.17)" is arithmetically 7.17, and its attribution to a per-JOB cost cannot be right, because differencing two job totals cancels every per-job term.
- **VALUES BIT-IDENTICAL in all FOUR generic combinations, against two independent C oracles.** `tb_attn_block` BIT-EXACT vs `ref/attn_block_vec.c` over 130 values x4 arms; `tb_attn_kv_seam` BIT-EXACT vs `ref/attn_block_seq_vec.c` over 2,056 output values AND 2,176 record bytes in HBM x4 arms, every beat matched to its requested layer and position. Verdict text identical in all eight; wall time falls monotonically in the expected order.
- **TEETH: 23 rows, 9 KILLED, 13 SURVIVED, 1 ABORT, every row under its own name and an attribution control on both new checks.** `E3`/`E4`/`E5` are three clean attributed kills (`se_sent`, P_HDR's fallback for the bypass position, the disjointness gate). **`E2` DID NOT BITE** -- `all_zero(sq_busy)` is defence in depth, never the binding condition. **`E1` was a BADLY BUILT MUTANT** (it moved the new assert's own guard) and `E1c`/`E1b` show the behaviour it meant to break is value-neutral. **The new assert is NOT a new detection**: `H0c`/`H7c` with it disabled are KILLED anyway, and `tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd:1082` fires in the SAME cycle.
- **THE MUTANTS CHANGED THE RTL, and that is the result worth carrying.** `E6` and `E7` were written to be inert and were both KILLED, which said the design had an unstated property: **`se_rdy` is a level with no deadline**, so an arm that missed its window fired later at P_EPW carrying the header of the position just finished. Fixed with one line at the top of P_HDR (`if SCORE_EARLY then se_rdy <= '0'; end if;`); the whole A/B, both oracles and all seven rate arms were RE-RUN against the hardened file. It is free at the card geometry (all four arms identical to the digit) and costs ONE CYCLE in one of eight oracle runs.
- **GATE, five groups, every one GREEN, and the md5 window is why the verdict stands.** `tb_csweep_rate` **PASS 1**, `tb_attn` **PASS 16 / NOCHECK 1 / SKIPPED 4** (its standing shape, unchanged), `seamgate` **PASS 6**, `tb_llama_top_kv` **PASS 1**, `kvmap` **PASS 1**, FAIL 0 everywhere. **THE FIRST FIVE-GROUP RUN WAS GREEN AND VOID:** its guard caught `rtl/llama_top.vhd` moving `4acda69a` -> `2ac7456b` mid-run (TRACK GSRWIDE's `SWG_LANES`/`SWG_WIDE`). `sim/regress.sh` never moved. The three groups that compile or PARSE `llama_top` were re-run in fresh windows, and the other two as well; every quoted window printed `MD5_MATCH`.
- **NEXT, for whoever runs the next card build** -- **not this track's file**: at `rtl/llama_top.vhd:6621`, `NORM_LANES => 1, STRICT_PRODUCER => true, SWEEP_PIPE => true, SCORE_EARLY => true)`. Then regenerate `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` via `tools/gen_cardtop.py`, `git diff` it, and run `sim/regress.sh --only cardtop`. DERIVED on the card with both: token slope **2,793.4 -> 1,818.1**, tok/s **+5.9%** at 2,048, **+17.8%** at 8,192, **+42.8%** at 65,536; the intercept does not move.
- **OPEN, and the first one still gates a build:** the AREA and TIMING cost of BOTH generics is **UNMEASURED** (no Vivado lane; `SCORE_EARLY` is DERIVED 2 flip-flops plus control, an ESTIMATE) -- **do not set either on a build without an OOC run**. Also: the full score/PV overlap is unbuilt and its ~26-cycle ceiling is DERIVED from the phase table, not measured; `SCORE_EARLY` has not been run above RD_LAT 100 and it shrinks the prefetch runway further; the rescale term is 0.00 here and is still NOT bounded for the card; `pk_cnt`/`pv_cnt` still do not saturate (CSWEEP's item); and shortening the 15-cycle header pass itself (a tree-min plus parallel subtracts, about 4 cycles) was named and not attempted because its area and path cannot be costed without Vivado.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK PATHFREE: the tree built in one directory only; both of GATEDAY's path reds are cured and the off-path gate is green except `sim:ipsync`

- **Files owned and changed:** the 36 load-bearing files listed below, `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-tree-only-builds-in-one-directory.md`, this entry. Commit `3219cb0`. **No hardware, no Vivado** (workstation lane held by a `FK33_CARD=1` place-and-route, BC-250 by TRACK LEVERCOST).
- **THE TWO COUNTS. 199 tracked files contain `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl`; 36 are load-bearing and 163 are documents and `results/` logs.** The 163 are **deliberately untouched**: rewriting them to claim a path that was not what ran would falsify the record. The brief's prior count of 31 was low by five (`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd`, `gen_hbmbw.py`, `fk33_bisect_layers.sh`, and two multi-occurrence `sim/ooc_*.tcl`). **30 of the 36 now derive the root; 6 keep a literal for a stated reason.**
- **MEASURED, ten rows, both trees at `3219cb0`, `--jobs 1`: main and an off-path worktree give the IDENTICAL result -- nine PASS, `sim:ipsync` FAIL.** `sim:runguard` and `sim:fk33card` were the two reds and both are green off-path now. **With the attribution control run**: the *pre-fix* generators from `747d502`, dropped into the *same* worktree at the *same* commit, still ABORT and still say STALE. One variable and it moves the verdict.
- **THE TWO REDS HAD DIFFERENT CAUSES, and only one was a path that should have been derived.** `sim:runguard` was a MATCHING defect: `gen_pcieep.py` built its substitution target from its **own** `__file__` and searched for it inside the **tracked** tcl, so the abort printed the worktree's path and read as though the tracked file were wrong. `sim:fk33card` was a COMPARISON defect: the hex-image generics **must** stay absolute (`file_open` resolves from Vivado's cwd) and the generator already computed them right; `--check` was asking "was this generated in THIS directory". It now compares modulo the repo prefix and **prints the prefix it saw**, so a post-rename stale file is still visible. Four mutations: the prefix-only one passes, filename / subdirectory / ordinary-byte all still bite.
- **THE FINDING THAT WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE CARD BUILD, and no bench could have caught it.** `$tgRoot` **cannot** be a bare `[file dirname [info script]]`. `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh:69` does `cp build_fk33_pcieep.tcl "$BUILD_ROOT/"` and sources the **copy**, so during a card build the script's own location is `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/build10/root` (READ FROM `/proc/PID/cwd` of the live build, not inferred) and a location-derived root resolves to `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds`. So `$tgRoot` tries an env override, then the script's location, then a generation-time literal, and **accepts a candidate only if `rtl/util_pkg.vhd` exists under it**. Six `tclsh` scenarios including the copied-out-of-tree case and two that must fail.
- **THREE GENERATED OUTPUTS DELIBERATELY NOT REGENERATED, and two of those refusals were forced by a control that FIRED.** `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`: a plain run deleted 496 lines (`CAPS_VOCAB 248320` -> `0`, the whole card section gone) because the committed file was built with `FK33_CARD=1`; re-running **with** it still differed in `FK33_CB_STYLE` and a 75 MHz CLKOUT3. **The committed tcl is the artifact of an environment combination recorded nowhere in the file.** `build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl`: the control run before editing produced **287 deletions** -- already stale against its own generator, predating this track. Both were reverted byte for byte. `build_fk33_i2cprobe.tcl` **was** regenerated, but only after a control proved it regenerates byte-identical first.
- **MY OWN OFF-BY-ONE WAS CAUGHT BY THE PROBE, NOT BY ME.** The first `REPO` in `gen_i2cprobe.py` was one level short and emitted `.../llama.vhdl/hw` as the fallback; the `rtl/util_pkg.vhd` probe rejected it. That is the argument for probing a derived root rather than trusting it. Separately, `info complete` on a whole file is **not** a boundary check: the bulk Tcl rewrite inserted a block into the middle of a line-continued `expr` in `sim/ooc_mover_paths.tcl` and the file **still parsed**. Only `info complete` on the text *up to* the insertion point found it.
- **`sim:ipsync` IS UNTOUCHED AND STILL RED, and it is a real defect.** GATEDAY's bisection re-confirmed by hashing both sides: `ip_repo/` copy **has not moved since `cb2600f`**, `rtl/` moved once at `09f68a0` (a `prompt_len_i` rewire). **Next owner, on a free Vivado lane:** `vivado -mode batch -nojournal -source ip_repo/package_llama_ip.tcl` then `python3 ip_repo/check_ip_sync.py`. That packager is now path-free, so it no longer has to run from the canonical directory.
- **`BASELINE_PASS` STAYS AT 130 and this track did not touch it.** The DERIVED floor is unchanged at **153**; what changed is that it is now *observable*, because a checkout can at last be both clean and off the canonical path. The one command that would establish it is in section 9 of the write-up. **Do not put 153 on the line from anything but a green full run.**
- **OPEN, not determined:** no Vivado has executed any changed Tcl -- the root derivation is proven under `tclsh` and the surrounding Vivado commands are unchanged, but the next `pcieep_build.sh` is the first real execution (it fails loudly and within seconds if at all); the 23 `sim/ooc_*.tcl` and three packagers are likewise unrun; why `build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` is 287 lines stale; and which environment produced the committed `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`.
- **NEXT:** the `llama.vhdl` -> `llm.vhdl` rename is now nearly free -- after the `mv`, the only actions are `python3 hw/fk33/gen_i2cprobe.py` (refreshes the `$tgRoot` fallback literal) and `python3 hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` (refreshes the two hex-image generics, which must stay absolute). `pcieep_build.sh` regenerates its own tcl on every build, so it needs nothing.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK GATEDAY: the first unfiltered gate since the ten landings is PASS 155 FAIL 3, and two of the three reds are the PATH rather than the tree

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/regress.sh` (the `BASELINE_PASS` comment only), `tools/ref9b/README.md`, this entry. Commit `3062aa4`. **No hardware, no Vivado** (the one lane held a card build the whole time).
- **THE GATE, MEASURED at `e573f5d`, `--jobs 1`, 82m09s wall, cgroup `memory.peak` 3.30 GiB** (3,543,232,512 B, well under its 8G cap, so a real peak and not the cap). **The brief's 2.13 GiB figure is low**: that number was for a run this one is not, and a both-suite run reaches 3.3. `OVERALL PASS 155 FAIL 3 NOVERDICT 0 TIMEOUT 0 BUILD-ERROR 0 NOCHECK 4 SKIPPED 6`.
- **It ran in a `git worktree` pinned at `e573f5d`, and that was the right call, not caution theatre.** Mid-run, another track modified `sim/tb_gdn_block.vhd` and HEAD moved `e573f5d` -> `059f8d1`; five concurrent GHDL processes from TRACK BRECUR and TRACK CSWEEP were live at one point. A main-checkout run would have compiled a file that was changing underneath it, and this file already records three rows sharing one bench body reporting `FAIL 3`, `FAIL 1` and `PASS 1` in a single run for exactly that reason.
- **THE FINDING: THE GATE IS NOT PATH-INDEPENDENT.** Two of the three FAILs are artefacts of running anywhere other than `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl`, and both PASS in the main checkout. Measured both ways rather than assumed, which is what separates this from "the gate went red".
  - `sim:runguard` -- `hw/fk33/build_fk33_i2cprobe.tcl` is **tracked** and hardcodes `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl/hw/fk33/fk33_i2cprobe.xdc`, so `gen_pcieep.py`'s substitution target is absent off-path and it ABORTS before grading anything.
  - `sim:fk33card` -- the generated `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` embeds absolute `NORM_W_IMAGE` and `C_QKN_IMAGE` hex paths; regenerating in the worktree differs in **exactly those two lines** and `--check` calls the committed file STALE.
  - This is the recorded "a fact about the harness reported as a fact about the job" trap in a new place, and it would have cost the next person two attributions.
- **THE ONE GENUINELY RED ROW IS NOT FROM TODAY.** `sim:ipsync`: `ip_repo/llama_engine_axi_1_0/src/llama_engine_axi.vhd` is 20,045 bytes against `rtl/`'s 20,328. Bisected: **IDENTICAL at `cb2600f`, DIFFERS from `09f68a0`** ("GHDL 6.0 portability", **2026-09-19**) onward -- that commit edited the RTL and never re-ran the packager. **It went unseen for a day because no unfiltered run was made**, which is the whole argument for making one. **Fixing it needs Vivado** (the packager), so it is not closable from a no-Vivado track. **OPEN, and it is the next owner's item.**
- **`BASELINE_PASS` STAYS AT 130, and the comment now says why in full.** Three independent reasons, only the first of which is obvious: the run was RED so no floor comes off it at all; the 155 includes the four `.mv4i` model rows so the script printed its own refusal; and the recorded workaround (`MV4I_FK33_FILE=/nonexistent` on a clean tree) is blocked by the path dependence above, because a checkout can be clean **or** at the canonical path but the only tree that is both is the main one, which carries ~18 untracked `sim/tb_*.vhd` rows. The honest clean-at-canonical-path number is **DERIVED 153** (155 - 4 optional + 2 path artefacts) and the comment says explicitly **do not put 153 on the line**, because it has never been observed.
- **NEXT, in order:** re-package `llama_engine_axi` to close `sim:ipsync` (needs Vivado); then a full gate in the MAIN checkout with `MV4I_FK33_FILE=/nonexistent` and the untracked `sim/tb_*.vhd` moved aside, and raise the floor from that green number. **Cheaper long-term fix: make those two absolute paths relative**, which also makes the worktree route work and would let the floor be measured from a pinned sha ever after.
- **THE 9B REFERENCE IS BACK, AND ITS CANONICAL PATH IS NOW `/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/refs/tok0.r9bs`** (5,976,368 bytes), not a scratch directory -- the previous copy lived only in a `/tmp` session scratchpad and a drive cleanup deleted it. Regenerated with `./ref/run9b --packed /mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen35-9b-mv4i-qkvpad --acts bfp --tokens 248045 --out <that path>`; **MEASURED 32.3 s and 4.28 GiB peak RSS**, run alone after the gate finished. **Verified by its recorded property, not by its size**: `TOKEN` record **846** (REPORTED, `run9b`'s own argmax), `LOGITS n=248320 f32 max=+12.7822 rms=2.50779`, gap/rms 0.40106 -- every field matching `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-card-cannot-publish-a-logit-vector.md`, and the byte count landing on 5,976,368 exactly. Teeth: `check_token.py --expect 845` exits 1, so the check discriminates.
- **TWO CORRECTIONS TO HOW THAT FILE WAS BEING DESCRIBED**, both of which this repository had already written down and a brief had already lost: it is **rung 3** (`ref/run9b --acts bfp`, the hardware model), **not a BF16 capture**; and its prompt is the **single token 248045**, **not the 23-token DC-DC prompt**. Token 0 is **846** for this prompt and **1206** for the DC-DC one, the 09-20 write-up lists comparing them under *measured and REJECTED*, and the numbers come out well formed either way -- so the mix-up is silent. `tools/ref9b/README.md` now carries all of this next to the command.



### 2026-09-20 TRACK CSWEEP: C's 5.14 cycles per beat is NOT a narrow mover. It is a per-POSITION FSM, the cache costs ZERO, and `SWEEP_PIPE` takes 22.5% off the slope

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/attn_block.vhd` (new generic `SWEEP_PIPE`, OFF by default), new `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd`, new `sim/mutate_attn_sweep_pipe.sh`, pass-through generic added to `sim/tb_attn_block.vhd` and `sim/tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd`. `rtl/attn_kv_axi.vhd` UNCHANGED. **No hardware, no Vivado** (the box's one lane was on a card build all day). Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_c-sweeps-at-5-cycles-per-beat.md`.
- **PER-BEAT vs PER-POSITION, settled first because the brief said that was the whole question. It is PER POSITION and it is NOT a fourth narrow-mover finding.** MEASURED, `sim/tb_csweep_rate.vhd` at the REAL 9B geometry with a pipelined 100-cycle HBM model: one position of one KV head is **87.42 cycles = KSPAN 7.00 + MIDGAP 56.42 + VSPAN 7.00 + LOOP 17.00**, x N_KVH 4 = **349.68 against the card's 349.2, a 0.14% agreement**. The 16 beats of data movement are 16% of the position; 64.5% is the score-and-softmax chain with nothing overlapped onto it.
- **THE CACHE COSTS ZERO, and there are two independent proofs.** `krdy_low = vrdy_low = 0` at every position, and the `IDEAL_CACHE` control -- `attn_kv_axi` removed entirely, `_rdy` tied high -- reproduces **the same integers** (kspan 1792, midgap 14444, vspan 1792, loop 4284 at position 64). An RD_LAT sweep leaves every span unchanged; only the per-JOB constant moves. **Do not open a wider port, a deeper burst, a larger MAXOUT or a larger RBUF against this number.** MAXB cannot rise anyway: the FK33 HBM slave is AXI3 and `rtl/hbm_tg_ip.vhd:1036` truncates ARLEN to 4 bits.
- **FIX, `SWEEP_PIPE`, DEFAULTING TO THE OLD BEHAVIOUR:** fetch the V record of this position while the score and the softmax drain, and the K record of the NEXT position during P_PV and P_POSN. `krec` is free from the end of P_SCORE and the quantizer cannot be concurrent with the sweep, so **no double buffer**. MEASURED: per pair **87.42 -> 67.37**, slope **355.17 -> 275.11 (-22.5%)**, and `SWEEP_PIPE=false` is **identical on every number** to `git show HEAD:rtl/attn_block.vhd` built into its own library. DERIVED on the card: per job **349.2 -> 269.1**, token slope **2,793.4 -> 2,152.7**, and tok/s +3.8% at 2,048, **+11.0% at 8,192, +24.5% at 65,536**; the last supported token costs 5.68x the first instead of 7.08x.
- **VALUES ARE BIT-IDENTICAL, against two independent C oracles, not a round trip.** `tb_attn_block` BIT-EXACT against `ref/attn_block_vec.c` over 130 values with the generic both ways; `tb_attn_kv_seam` BIT-EXACT against `ref/attn_block_seq_vec.c` over **2,056 output values AND 2,176 record bytes in HBM** both ways, with every returned beat matched to the layer and position it was requested for. The seam run is 2,040 ns faster with it on. Final-tree gate, one invocation per group: `tb_csweep_rate` **PASS 1**, `tb_attn` **PASS 16**, `seamgate` **PASS 6**, `tb_llama_top_kv` **PASS 1**, `kvmap` **PASS 1**, FAIL 0 everywhere.
- **NEXT, one line for whoever runs the next card build:** `SWEEP_PIPE => true` at the `attn_block` instance in `rtl/llama_top.vhd` (and therefore `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, which is generated from it) -- **not this track's files.**
- **OPEN, and the first one gates the next step:** the AREA and TIMING cost of `SWEEP_PIPE` is **UNMEASURED** (no Vivado lane was free; DERIVED ~23 FF plus a 4-bit mux, an ESTIMATE). `MIDGAP`'s 56.42 cycles have NOT been split -- about 40 of them are the `attn_score_q12` drain plus the `attn_softmax` state machine, and **that is where 84% of what remains lives**. Whether position p+1's SCORE can run while position p's softmax drains is the next lever and was not attempted.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK BRECUR: the GDN recurrence is NOT serial, and 98,422 of `gdn_block`'s 149,579 cycles are a BENCH DEFAULT

- **Files owned and changed:** `sim/tb_gdn_block.vhd` (additive instrumentation only, 124 lines), new `sim/ooc_gdn_recur_pipe_lanes.tcl`, new `hw/fk33/results/brecur_ooc_2026-09-20/`. **No RTL changed.** No hardware. **No Vivado on the workstation** -- its lane was on the card build all day; the four area draws ran on the BC-250. Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-gdn-recurrence.md`.
- **THE ANSWER: it is one generic, and it is already threaded.** `rtl/llama_top.vhd:816` ships `B_RECUR_LANES = 4` while `rtl/gdn_block.vhd:207` defaults the same generic to **32** and calls it "section 3.1's assumption". The only justification given for the 4 is that it is *"the exact set `sim/tb_gdn_block.vhd` defaults to"*. The sweep is `VAL_HEADS*DIM*(DIM/RECUR_LANES)`, so the lane count divides the largest phase of a B job directly.
- **MEASURED at 9B, `tb_gdn_block`, producers eager:** `RECUR_LANES=4` -> **149,579** cycles (`recur 131,134`); `RECUR_LANES=16` -> **51,157** (`recur 32,830`). **-98,422 cycles, -65.8%.** The 4-lane baseline reproduces TRACK BMOVER's independent 149,579 **to the cycle**. `st_req` equals the derived `VAL_HEADS*DIM*NB_R` exactly in both.
- **WHAT IS TRULY SERIAL: only the token position.** Heads are independent; the column loop is ALREADY pipelined at `NB = DIM/LANES`; and the `DIM` elements inside a column are independent and are visited `LANES` at a time **only because the state memory port is `LANES*16` bits wide**. At the shipping 4, the four per-lane multipliers are idle **31/32 of the time**. This is a loop written serially, not a dependency.
- **THE CEILING IS IN THE MOVER, NOT THE ARITHMETIC, and it is a file B does not own.** `rtl/gdn_state_axi.vhd:212` is `constant WPB : positive := AXI_DW / WBITS` with `WBITS = RECUR_LANES*16`, `AXI_DW = 256`, so **`RECUR_LANES <= 16`**, and `:232` forces exact tiling. The reachable set is `{1,2,4,8,16}`. **`gdn_block`'s own default of 32 does not elaborate on the card at all** -- and it fails as a bare `positive` bound-check, not as one of that file's named refusals.
- **VALUES BIT-IDENTICAL.** The two 9B dumps, normalised on the one lane-dependent index, match **byte for byte over 532,481 lines** (the whole y stream, all 524,288 state mantissas, all 4,096 exponents), md5 `9545a7f0...`. The raw files differ in size, so the normalisation is load-bearing. Plus `tb_gdn_block_vec` PASS against `ref/gdn_block_vec.c`.
- **AREA, MEASURED, four OOC draws on the BC-250**, one Vivado, `MemoryHigh=10G`, all one session/one tree: DSP **17 / 33 / 65 / 129** at LANES 4/8/16/32 (`4*LANES+1` exactly at every point), LUT **9,427 / 12,549 / 17,292 / 27,861**, BRAM 3.5 / 6.5 / 12.5 / 24.5, Fmax 299.0 MHz unchanged. **Shipping -> proposed is +48 DSP (of 793 free), +9 BRAM (of 105), +7,865 LUT against a card at 99.81% CLB.** **The HBM arena does not move** -- 32,768 beats of 256 bits either way -- so no manifest, no re-image, no host change.
- **THE CONTROL HALF-PASSED, and that is a result.** The LANES=32 row reproduces the published **129 DSP** exactly and does **NOT** reproduce the published **24,037 LUT** (measured **27,861**, +15.9%). That figure is from a 2026-08-26 tree, before the head-boundary double buffer, and a different part suffix. **Do not quote 24,037 for `gdn_recur_pipe` again without re-deriving it.** This sweep's internal deltas are unaffected -- all four rows are same-tree.
- **TEETH.** `PH_ORDER` killed a value-neutral mutant (conv read enable asserted during the sweep) and its **attribution control (`PH_ORDER=false`) PASSES every value check**, so it is the SOLE detector. **`PH_ISSUE` is reported as NOT shown to discriminate**: every mutant built for it is caught first by `gdn_recur_pipe:670` or `:794`, and it is an end-of-run check so a deadlocking mutant never reaches it. Kept as a derivation pin; **must not be credited with a kill later.** The five printed spans sum to the total ALGEBRAICALLY, so no assertion was put on that sum -- it would be decoration.
- **GATES:** `--only gdn` **PASS 21 FAIL 0 NOCHECK 1** (the pre-existing `tb_gdn_conv_cycles`, unchanged); `--only bmover` **PASS 1 FAIL 0**; `--only tb_llama_top_b` **PASS 3 FAIL 0**; `--only seamgate` **PASS 6 FAIL 0** including `bconst`. Note every seamgate row is at LANES=4, because `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd` does not expose `B_RECUR_LANES`.
- **NEXT, and it is ONE LINE for whoever runs the next card build:** add `"--generic", "B_RECUR_LANES=16",` to `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` beside the `B_*` generics already at `:148/:158/:170`. Nothing else -- `rtl/llama_top.vhd:816` already maps it into both `u_gdn` and `u_state`, and `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd:851` already carries it. **DERIVED saving: 24 jobs x 98,422 = 2,362,128 cycles a token, 31.5 ms at 75 MHz**; the B job goes 222,805 -> ~124,383. **The risk is CLB, not cycles or DSP**, and only a routed `FK33_CARD=1` build answers it.
- **OPEN:** the **drain phase, 8,977 cycles** -- 49% of the non-recurrence cost and 17.3% of the block after this lever, and TRACK BMOVER's attribution list does not mention it at all; no attribution is offered here and the measurement that would settle it (last `st_ren` to last `y_valid`) is one span this bench does not print. Also: LUT in context rather than OOC; post-route Fmax at 16; the oracle at LANES=16 (blocked on one generic in `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`, another track's file); and the unexplained 2.5% bench-to-card residual BMOVER also saw.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK AIDLE: A's 0.51 cycles per weight word is ONE LINE in the FIFO, it is 96.7% per-word, and closing it costs ZERO LUTs

- **Files owned and changed:** `rtl/{stream_fifo,async_fifo,axi_rd_port,weight_streamer,matvec_int4,matvec_int4_desc_axi}.vhd`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py` + its generated `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd`, new `sim/ooc_aidle{.tcl,_run.sh}`. Commits `1a36aec`, `29b9ddd`. **No hardware. No Vivado on the workstation** -- the three area draws ran on the BC-250, whose lane was idle all day. Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_a-accept-port-idle.md`.
- **PER-JOB vs PER-WORD, settled first because the brief said the distinction was the whole question.** DSIDE's fit over all 311 A_JOB steps gives `engine = 294.07 + 1.51010 * beats`; the token's excess over the 1-cycle-per-word floor is **2,737,524 cycles, of which the per-job constant is 91,456 (3.34%) and the per-word term is 2,646,056 (96.66%)**. **It is a per-word stall.** Every per-job cost in A added together is capped at 0.30% of the token; do not open one against this number again.
- **ROOT CAUSE, and it is one line in `rtl/stream_fifo.vhd` and the identical line in `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`:** `do_rd <= '1' when mcnt > 0 and (ocnt + inflight) < 2` counts the beat LEAVING the two-entry output stage at this same edge as if it were staying. **MEASURED with a perfect producer and a perfect consumer, no AXI and no array in the loop: 1.501 cycles per beat, q_valid low 1,003 of 3,003 cycles.** `matvec_core.vhd:860` accepts a word only when all 27 ports present a beat in the SAME cycle, so 1.5 in the FIFO is 1.5 in the array. The card's own fitted slope is **1.51010** -- the gap to 1.5000 is everything HBM, the address map, the CDC, MAXOUT, MAXB and the AR throttle contribute put together.
- **FIX, behind `FAST_POP`, DEFAULTING TO THE OLD BEHAVIOUR:** bound on what the stage holds AFTER this edge's pop, `after_e = ocnt + inflight - pop < 2`. Same invariant one pop later; order and values untouched. **MEASURED, 100x4096 ideal memory: 613 -> 422 cycles, W-stall 202 -> 10, cycles/word 1.5963 -> 1.0989.** On the real `M=2048,K=4096` shape (48 jobs a token): **8,333 -> 5,582, -33.0%**. **DERIVED on the card: 2,593,664 cycles a token, 8.61% of the striped token, zero DSPs, and it helps GENERATION as well as prefill** -- 94.4% of the 2,746,816 PREFILL identified as the whole prize, which its row 5 wanted 1,536 non-existent DSPs for.
- **AREA, MEASURED on the BC-250, three OOC draws of `weight_streamer` at the FK33 geometry.** `base` (pre-change RTL from git) and `ctrl` (FAST_POP=false) are IDENTICAL on every number, so the default-off path prunes to the shipping netlist. `fast` is identical too on LUT/FF/CARRY8/BRAM and the census shows why: **27 LUT4 become LUT5, one per read port, and the LUT TOTAL does not move.** **Zero extra LUTs against a card at 99.81% CLB.** Harness teeth test: a fourth draw at `NPORTS_W=12` moves LUT 10,192 -> 5,663, so that is a measurement and not a silence.
- **THE ONE RISK, and it is TIMING, not area.** The new term puts `q_ready` into `do_rd`, and in context `q_ready` is the AND of 24 weight FIFOs' `q_valid` with the 3 scale ports and `xq_cnt`, fanning back to all 27 read enables. OOC gives up **0.424 ns on the core clock (11.709 -> 11.285 of 13.333)** and the binding aclk path does not move at all -- but OOC treats `q_ready` as a port. **That 0.424 ns is a LOWER BOUND; only a routed FK33_CARD=1 build answers it**, and the shipped build routes at WNS +0.001. Fallback if it does not close: register `q_ready` into `do_rd`, one FF per port, giving back part of the lever -- not designed, not measured.
- **NEXT, and it is one line for whoever runs the next card build:** `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py` `FAST_POP_DEFAULT = False -> True`, regenerate, `git diff` the output. Then read the CORE-clock row of the timing summary (the global WNS lives in the AXI domain and will not move), confirm CLB does not move, and read the engine's `CYCLES`/`BEATS` registers per job: **expected ratio about 1.01 against today's 1.51.** Nobody has ever read those two registers per job on the card.
- **OPEN:** the in-context timing above; no DUAL_CLK rate simulation (every number here is single-clock, as TRACK COUNTERS' were); a 3.2% bench-to-card residual at the 2048x4096 shape, same direction and same size as BMOVER's unexplained 2.5%; whether HBM can actually sustain one word per core cycle (DERIVED yes at 60% duty on the busiest pseudo-channel, never measured); and **`rtl/fk33_eng_cdc.vhd`'s two `async_fifo` instances carry the same 2-in-3 cadence, are another track's file, and nobody has asked whether D's 2,963,566 cycles of `S_XRD`/`S_DRAIN` contain any of it.**

### 2026-09-20 TRACK BNARROWSYN: `NWIDE` costs the +28 BRAM tiles it was DERIVED to cost and REFUNDS 368 LUT and 1,659 FF; URAM takes the whole thing and gives 28 tiles back

- **No hardware. Four OOC Vivado draws of `gdn_state_store` at 9B**, one at a
  time, `MemoryHigh=10G`, none at its cap (peaks 3.1-3.4 GB, zero swap).
  `sim/ooc_bnarrow_run.sh` + `sim/ooc_bnarrow.tcl`, raw output in
  `hw/fk33/results/bnarrow_ooc_2026-09-20/`, write-up appended as the last
  section of `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_b-job-660k-cycles.md` (append only).
- **MEASURED, all arms at `PIPE WIDE MAXOUT=8` so `ctrl` IS the card path.**
  `NWIDE=true`: **+28 BRAM tiles (28 -> 56), -368 LUT, -1,659 FF**, URAM/DSP
  and the synthesis WNS estimate unchanged to the digit. The DERIVED tile
  figure was exact; the LOGIC term has the other sign, because the three
  movers give back more than the memories take (`u_edma` -298 LUT/-808 FF,
  `u_cdma` -183/-806, `u_kdma` -373/-297 against `u_conv` +484, `u_cw` +385).
- **`CONV_STYLE => "ultra"` takes the unit's Block RAM Tile count to ZERO**:
  112 banks -> 112 URAM288, `8-10226` and `8-7186` **0 in all four logs**,
  census names all 144 URAM. DERIVED on the placed card that is 567 -> **539
  tiles (133 free)** and URAM 32 -> 144 of 320. It needs the `chk_style`
  guard widened in `rtl/gdn_conv_tap_mem.vhd` and `rtl/gdn_conv_w_mem.vhd`.
- **THE REJECTED 12-BANK ARM WAS REJECTED FOR THE WRONG REASON.** Built,
  bench-verified (107/107, two mutations of the sub-word decode FAIL 45 and 4),
  drawn: **12 RAMB36, no LUT-as-memory blowup** -- so "refusal 1" does not
  apply to a decoded sub-word write, and the header's "same tile count" is
  wrong by 2x. It still loses, on the axis nobody argued about: **+650 LUT**.
- **VERDICT for the next card build: `NWIDE => true` FITS** (77 free tiles
  after it, 105 before, and CLB pressure goes DOWN). **Hold `ultra` one
  question**: the BRAM mapping report states `READ_FIRST` per port and the
  **Ultra RAM report has no write-mode column at all**, and neither GHDL nor
  OOC synthesis can tell you what a URAM288 returns on a same-address
  collision. Diffs for both levers are in the results README; the files
  (`rtl/llama_top.vhd` and the two memories) belong to other tracks.
- **TRAP, recorded because it nearly fired:** the rejected arm's source is a
  SECOND `gdn_conv_tap_mem`, and `sim/regress.sh:1472` globs `sim/*.vhd` into
  one provider slot per design unit. In `sim/` it would have silently
  re-pointed every gate row at the rejected arm. It lives in the results
  directory instead. Also: a Vivado message count of exactly **100 is the
  message limit**, not a census -- five ids hit it here.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK WIDEDRAIN: lever L1 is applied, MEASURED in `llama_top` to the cycle, and the specified patch was wrong in three places

- **No hardware, no Vivado. GHDL only.** Write-up appended as section 10 of
  `docs/2026-09-20_d-side-vector-traffic.md` (append-only, DSIDE's sections
  1-9 untouched).
- **MEASURED in the integration top, not in an extracted copy** -- which is
  the open item DSIDE 6.3 left. `sim/tb_llama_top_real` (drain narrow)
  **26,382 cycles** a token; `sim/tb_llama_top_wdrain`, the SAME generic map
  plus `A_DRAIN_WIDE => true`, **24,204**. Delta **2,178**. DERIVED from that
  schedule's 37 drained A jobs, `sum(M) = 2,904` against
  `sum(ceil(M/4)) = 726` = **2,178**. Model and integration agree to the
  cycle.
- **All four landmarks bit-identical across the arms**, `EXP_STEPH` included
  -- a running hash over EVERY region write, region-tagged, in order. The
  whole write STREAM is identical, not just the residual.
- **THE PATCH AS SPECIFIED REFUSES THE WHOLE TREE.** Its elaboration pin is
  `0 - (A_ROWS_IF mod LANES)` and llama_top's defaults are `A_ROWS_IF = 4`,
  `LANES = 8` -- a negative `natural` in every configuration including
  `A_DRAIN_WIDE => false`. `A_ROWS_IF = 4` is forced: `A_NPORTS` is the
  package constant 5. Pinned on `boolean'pos(A_DRAIN_WIDE)` instead, and
  widened to admit both nestings.
- **AND IT WAS IN THE WRONG ARM FOR THE CARD.** `llama_top.vhd:4394` is
  `ga_real`; the card sets `A_DESC` and runs `ga_desc`, which lives inside
  `tools/gen_cardtop.py`. Applying L1 to `rtl/llama_top.vhd` alone saves the
  card NOTHING. Applied to both; the generated `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`
  carries it.
- **THERE IS A THIRD `v_reg_d` SITE AND IT IS THE INSTRUMENT.** `wsump`, the
  observability write hash, read the D-vec destination as if it were the
  group port's region. Found by the bench, not by reading: three landmarks
  agreed and `EXP_STEPH` moved 17333 -> 26718. The data was right and the
  observer was wrong.
- **VERIFIED, not trusted:** 311 A jobs at the 9B shape, 296 draining,
  `dst_off` in {0, 2048, 4096} and `n_rows mod 8 = 0` for every one.
  `sum(M) = 1,426,944` -> `178,368`, **saving 1,248,576 a token (4.15%
  striped)**. One number sharpened: `build_plan`'s default is 297 A jobs; 311
  is the count with the lm_head's 15 windows.
- **A_DRAIN_WIDE STAYS FALSE.** It has never been synthesised, the fallback
  is a run-time branch so both muxes are built, and only a routed A/B answers
  timing. The ask is one OOC or routed pair, not a card build on trust.
- Files: `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `tools/gen_cardtop.py`,
  `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` + `sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd` (generated),
  `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd` (one generic), `sim/tb_llama_top_wdrain.vhd` (new
  row), `sim/mutate_a_drain_wide.sh` (new teeth).

### 2026-09-20 TRACK IMGLOCK: the card now says which image it is holding, and every tool refuses a manifest that disagrees

- **The defect, MEASURED this morning: nothing on the card recorded which
  packed image was resident and nothing on the host checked.** The flat
  manifest was driven at the lane-striped image; both declare
  `desc_arena_base = 0x1ffadd000`, so the flat descriptor table overwrote the
  striped one, and `pl_open` programmed the flat `kv_base = 0x10d93e000` into
  the KV seam register so C wrote its records into the WEIGHT image.
- **`109dc27` (C's KV base as a host-programmed register) is what made the
  striped image runnable and delivered 2.04x, AND is what converted this class
  from a wrong answer into data loss.** Both halves of that trade are real and
  the register stays. This is the guard it needed.
- **The interlock**: `fk33_load_weights.py load` writes a 512-byte IMAGE
  RECORD into the last 512 bytes of the descriptor arena extent the manifest
  already reserves (`0x1ffb03e00` on every 9B set) -- the eleven region
  numbers verbatim plus a BLAKE2b-128 PLACEMENT fingerprint over every piece
  address. `pl_open`, `fk33ctl.py seam --manifest`, `fk33_imgfp.py check` and
  `fk33_chat.sh` read it back and REFUSE on disagreement, naming both
  manifests and the field. It is invalidated BEFORE the first weight byte
  moves, so a load that dies half way leaves "no image", which is a refusal.
- **PLACEMENT, not content, and that is measured, not assumed.** All 250
  per-file `blake2b_128` are IDENTICAL across flat, striped and seg27, so no
  content digest separates them; `-striped` and `-striped-seg27` place all 250
  objects and every piece at IDENTICAL addresses and differ only in the GDN
  state and KV regions, so the `c419de7` byte probe cannot separate them
  either. That was its stated gap and it is now closed: the six packed sets
  fingerprint to six distinct values.
- **The incident predicted exactly from the two manifests: 35 objects, 0
  missed and 0 extra**, at every token count from 1 to 34, once `C_MAXPOS` is
  read from the CARD (65536) rather than from the morning's document
  (131072, which predicts 41).
- **TEETH, all green and all off-hardware:** `server/tests/imglock_selftest.c`
  13 rows / 15 checks against `fk33_sim` with **X3 the attribution control**
  (the same pair, no record: ACCEPTED, so nothing else in `pl_open` catches
  it) and **X12 the ordering row** (the refusal lands before the v2 program
  check, i.e. before any base register is written);
  `fk33_imgfp.py selfcheck` 32 rows including two NOT-BITING rows under their
  own names and a two-way C/Python cross-check; three new R rows in
  `fk33_load_weights.py selfcheck`.
- **Gate row `sim:imglock`** = `make -s -C server imglock-check`, all three
  suites in one command, **0.42 s, 24 MB peak**, no card, no model file, no
  `/mnt/storage`.
- **FOUND WHILE BUILDING IT, both recorded in the doc:** the record's
  `objs_loaded` was counted against `mani["files"]`, which omits the GDN
  constant image, so every full load recorded itself as PARTIAL (`5 of 4`);
  and a 512-byte write at `0x1f0027e00` made the loader selfcheck's sparse
  fake-HBM really extend to 8.32 GB, which the `M9` mutation then `f.read()`
  whole -- **18 MB / 0.05 s became 7,953 MB / 7.25 s while every row still
  printed PASS.** Bounded to `f.read(span)`: 20.5 MB / 0.10 s.
- **NEXT, and it needs the card, so the dispatcher runs it:** the resident
  seg27 image predates the record, so `fk33_chat.sh` will REFUSE (the byte
  probe reports both striped images and an ambiguous probe is a refusal by
  design). Run `fk33_load_weights.py verify <seg27 manifest>` then
  `fk33_imgfp.py write <seg27 manifest>`, then `fk33ctl.py seam --manifest
  <seg27 manifest>` and a bare `fk33_chat.sh` to confirm it selects seg27.
- **Files owned:** `hw/fk33/host/fk33_imgfp.py`, `fk33_load_weights.py`,
  `fk33_chat.sh`, `fk33ctl.py`, `fk33_resident_image.py`,

- **Full write-up:** `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_two-manifests-one-card.md`,
  with the REJECTED list (a new seam register; a carved page at the top of
  HBM, which has NO gap and would refuse every existing image until every
  manifest was re-derived; a host-side state file; a content digest).

### 2026-09-20 TRACK BNARROW: the three NARROW movers are beat-wide too -- 307,784 -> 222,805 cycles a B job, -84,979 at every read latency

- **Landed at `748ff91`.** One generic `NWIDE` on `rtl/gdn_state_store.vhd`,
  default FALSE, gives `gdn_exp_mem`, `gdn_conv_tap_mem` and `gdn_conv_w_mem`
  a beat-wide port and puts the exponent, conv-tap and constants movers in
  `gdn_state_axi`'s existing `WIDE` mode. Closes ranked fix 4 and the open
  item "the three small movers' per-beat cost" of
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_b-job-660k-cycles.md`, which now carries the full
  appended write-up.
- **THE MECHANISM WAS THE PORT WIDTH AND NOTHING ELSE.** MEASURED on this
  tree with PIPE+WIDE already on: `ld_exp 4,142`, `ld_conv 24,622`,
  `ld_const 33,069`, `sv_exp 4,114`, `sv_conv 24,593` = **90,540 of 307,784,
  29.4%**, i.e. 32 cycles per beat on the exponents and 16 on the other two.
  That is `WPB = AXI_DW/WORD_BITS` exactly. Not a handshake (PIPE removed
  that), not the shared AXI pair (the phases are serial and R was
  back-pressured 57,846 cycles), not latency (swept 0/40/80, `ld_conv` moves
  39 and 79 cycles -- once per phase).
- **MEASURED, `MAXOUT 8` as the card runs it, RD_LAT 0/40/80:**
  307,628/307,784/307,944 -> **222,649/222,805/222,965**, exactly **-84,979**
  at every latency. Per beat 32.4/16.0/16.0/32.1/16.0 ->
  1.35/1.03/1.02/1.14/1.01. All **770,970** value checks green including the
  adversarial stalled pass.
- **THE LATENCY SENSITIVITY INVERTS AT `MAXOUT 4`**, which is why it was
  swept: with NWIDE on, `ld_const` becomes 2,069/2,108/**3,236** because four
  bursts of 16 cover 64 cycles and the consumer now takes one. `MAXOUT 8`
  removes it (2,148 at RD_LAT 80) and the card already passes 8. NWIDE adds
  no new requirement, it depends on one already met.
- **VALUES, against an independent oracle, from ONE private worktree two
  lines apart:** `sim:seamgate_bconst` **PASS in both arms** (176s and 148s)
  against `tools/ref9b/gdn_oracle.py`. `tb_llama_top_bconst`, same two arms:
  all four pinned landmarks unchanged (`EXP_X0 => 10278` ...), `R_X
  bit-identical`, jobs issued / completions / KV records / KV beats identical
  element for element, and **-8,460 cycles per token, three times exactly**.
- **TEETH: 13 mutants, every attribution control green.** The row worth
  reading is **N6, which DID NOT BITE -- and that was a mutant defect, not a
  blind check.** Replacing a registered select with a combinational one while
  leaving the VHDL sensitivity list alone makes the mutation DEAD; it passed
  385,488 checks in one bench and 107 in another and was about to be written
  up as a resolution floor. With `ra_s` added to the list it kills 24,564
  checks. **N11** (done one beat early) hangs in BOTH arms, so its kill
  belongs to an older property and is not counted. **N12** (NWIDE not
  threaded through) moves no value at all: it is caught only by the new
  `BNARROW_BOUND` phase check, and with `-gNBOUND=false` it passes all
  385,483 value checks.
- **GATE, verbatim:** `--only gdn OVERALL PASS 21 FAIL 0 NOCHECK 1` (the
  NOCHECK is the pre-existing `tb_gdn_conv_cycles`, unchanged);
  `--only bmover OVERALL PASS 1`, `checks=770970 job_cycles=222805`;
  `--only tb_llama_top_b OVERALL PASS 3`.
- **NEXT, and it is one line the dispatcher applies**, because
  `rtl/llama_top.vhd` is TRACK DSIDE's file: in `u_state`'s generic map,
  `WIDE => true)` becomes `WIDE => true,` plus `NWIDE => true)`. Nothing else
  changes; llama_top is the input to three generators, so run the `--check`
  rows after.
- **DERIVED card effect** at 24 jobs a token, with the 2.5% bench-to-card
  residual carried rather than absorbed: **2.04 M (additive) to 2.09 M
  (proportional) cycles a token, 27.2 to 27.9 ms at 75 MHz**. On the
  lane-striped image that is about 9.4% of the token, and BENABLE plus
  BNARROW together about 34%.
- **OPEN, and it is the first thing anyone should run: THE CENSUS.** No
  Vivado ran in this track. The two conv memories' WIDE arms are **48 and 64
  banks of 512 x 16**, DERIVED at +12 and +16 BRAM tiles (28 -> 56 in
  `gdn_state_store`); `gdn_exp_mem`'s 32-way banked distributed RAM is not
  even derived. The 12-bank alternative with a wider word has the same tiles
  and makes the UNIT write a sub-word slice, which is the refusal that
  MEASURED 0 BRAM and 28,160 LUT on `gdn_conv_tap_mem` once already -- so the
  bounded-area risk was taken deliberately over the silent-inference one.
  Count `[Synth 8-10226]` and `[Synth 8-7186]`, read
  `report_ram_utilization` and an object-level census, and do not transfer
  TRACK BMOVERSYN's 32 URAM288 result: different array, different shape.
- Also open: whether 512-deep banks pack; the 2.5% residual, inherited;
  `gdn_block`'s own 149,579 cycles are now **67%** of the job and the mover
  is 71,164, so the recurrence is the next lever, not the mover.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK PREFILL: batching A across prompt positions is a COSTED NO -- 1.100x, capped at K=2, and K=2 needs 1,536 DSPs against 793 free

- **Scoping only. No RTL changed, no hardware, no Vivado.** Peak RSS
  **10,944 KiB MEASURED** (`/usr/bin/time -v`, the manifest parse; everything
  else was awk/grep). Write-up: `docs/2026-09-20_prefill-batching-scope.md`.
- **THE CRUX, settled from the RTL.** The array is exactly one weight word
  wide, and it is an identity, not a ratio: `NPORTS_W * AXI_DW = 24 * 256 =
  6,144 = ROWS_IF * BLK * 4 = 48 * 32 * 4`, with the scale side matching at
  `3 * 256 = 48 * 16` (`hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py:84-98`, `:225-228`;
  `rtl/matvec_core.vhd:983-1008`). **So the structural floor is 1.000 cycles
  per word and the striped card MEASURES 1.5298: the multiplier array is busy
  65.4% of core cycles.** Per word it does `BLK*ROWS_IF = 1,536` products;
  K positions need K passes, so per-position cycles per word is
  `max(K,1.53)/K` -- **1.000 at K=2 and at every K after it. The ceiling is
  1.53x of A's engine time and K=4, 8, 16 are worth exactly what K=2 is.**
- **AND "BEATS" HAS NEVER MEANT AXI BEATS.** `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd:
  68-70` says so outright. Re-derived independently from the manifest's own
  shapes over the 249 tensors the profile touches: **5,184,256 weight words,
  0.0025% from the ACLK doc's 5,184,384**, = 3.98 GB of weight traffic a
  token. Read as AXI beats it is 166 MB, wrong by 24x (= `NPORTS_W`), and the
  engine would have looked memory-starved.
- **THE AMDAHL BOUND, and it is what decides it.** Batchable = A engine-side
  only = 7,931,072 of 30,115,246 = **26.3%**. B (52.6%) is recurrent
  (`gdn_recur_pipe.vhd:506`, `gdn_recur.vhd:595-600,632`,
  `gdn_block.vhd:889-894`) and fetches NO weight from HBM -- its projections
  are A-job outputs (`llama_top.vhd:5382,5399,5417,5438`). C writes one
  position (`attn_block.vhd:1433,1454`), sweeps the whole context
  (`:1665-1673`) and touches only the KV cache. The three VEC ops are
  element-wise with an on-chip ROM gain (`llama_top.vhd:466-467`). A's own
  card-side 2.96 M is per-position too. **Result: 1.100x today, 1.144x after
  BENABLE, and the hard ceiling with A's engine time at ZERO is 1.358x
  (1.570x after BENABLE).** 500-token prefill 200.8 s -> 182.5 s.
- **IT DOES NOT FIT ANYWAY.** MEASURED, the shipped build's own
  `bd_wrapper_utilization_placed.rpt`: **DSP 2,087 of 2,880 (793 free)** and
  **CLB 54,854 of 54,960 = 99.81% (106 free)**. K=2 wants +1,536 DSP and
  about 21,000 LUT of fabric adder tree. **The "109% LUT" figure is the
  2026-09-16 build and is superseded; the free-LUT count (76,585) is not
  headroom, the 106 free CLBs are.**
- **THE SHARPEST LINE IN THE REPORT.** Full batching and simply closing A's
  own accept-port idle save the **identical 2,746,816 cycles**, because both
  are capped by the same 1-word-per-cycle floor. One costs 1,536 DSPs that do
  not exist and helps prefill only; the other costs none and helps generation
  too. **Batching is the cheaper fix with a DSP bill attached.**
- **Ranked alternatives** (cycles/token): overlap positions t/t+1 (A||B)
  14.26 M, prefill-only, 0 DSP, **1.899x** (1.531x after BENABLE), LUT cost
  NOT estimated; BENABLE 8.28 M, both, landed; A clock split 3.98 M, both,
  unbuilt; close A's idle 2.75 M, both, 0 DSP; batching 2.75 M, prefill only,
  impossible. **Overlap and batching are equally prefill-only**, which is the
  argument for the other three.
- **Cross-reference TRACK DSIDE:** A's 1.25 M drain cycles through the
  one-element region port are inside the 2,963,566 card-side figure this
  track treats as non-amortisable, so DSIDE's fix and this verdict do not
  conflict -- DSIDE shrinks the serial part, which RAISES batching's ceiling
  and lowers its absolute value.
- **Open, not determined:** the slope of C against position (bandwidth floor
  272 cyc/position, FSM cost uncounted, under 2% at 500 tokens either way,
  and **no C_JOB has ever been measured at a position other than 0**); where
  A's 8,832 cycles per job of overhead go (the card's own `CYCLES`/`BEATS`
  counters can be read per job and nobody has); whether the overlap lever
  fits in 106 CLBs.
- **NEXT, and it is the operator's call:** nothing here is a dispatchable
  change. If prefill is the goal, scope the overlap lever's LUT cost; if
  throughput generally is the goal, rows 2-4 all beat it and two of them are
  already written.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK DSIDE: 5.15 M cycles a token go through a ONE-element region-file port while an EIGHT-element port sits beside it with one client; A's drain is 1.25 M of them and the fix is llama_top-only

- **The on-card control needs no new measurement.** Same length N = 4,096,
  same region file: `VEC_RES` (the group port) **1,058 cycles**, `VEC_NORM`
  (the element port) **11,336**. `seq_vec_res` reads TWO operand regions and
  writes one and is still **10.7x cheaper per element**. The region file has
  four ports (`llama_top.vhd:1334-1389`); the LANES = 8 group read (two
  operand regions at once) and group write (per-lane `w_be`) have exactly one
  client between them.
- **MEASURED census, 5,153,058 cycles = 17.11% of the striped token and 8.32%
  of the flat one:** A `S_XRD` 1,536,622, A `S_DRAIN` 1,426,944, `VEC_SWG`
  1,179,840, `VEC_NORM` 532,740, B 394,944, C 81,968.
- **TRACK ACLK's S_XRD/S_DRAIN figure is CONFIRMED to the cycle** and was
  0.21% low: `sum(K+2) + sum(M) = 2,963,566` exactly, plus `311 x 20` fixed
  states = 2,969,786, **27.26%** of the striped `A_JOB` total. All 311 steps
  fit `dur = K + M(drained) + 21 + 294 + 1.5101*beats` with residuals in
  **[-197, +81]**, sd 51.5 (0.147% of the mean step). **Two wrong-model
  controls:** charging the drain to the lm_head windows too gives max
  residual 13,356 (68x worse); dropping the `K+2` term gives 6,249 (32x).
- **CORRECTION to the brief:** `gvr` has TWO passes, not three (the gain is
  preloaded, `llama_top.vhd:3462-3470`), so the vector-movement total is
  **1,712,580**, not the 1,979,000 the brief DERIVED.
- **PROVED IN SIMULATION, new files `rtl/region_drain.vhd` and
  `sim/tb_region_drain.vhd`** (auto-discovered row, `OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`,
  48 checks, peak RSS 664 MB): the drain goes from `n + 2` to
  `ceil(n/8) + 2` cycles with both region images identical to an INDEPENDENT
  model over the whole 49,152-word address space, at twelve shapes including
  a non-multiple-of-8 tail and two misaligned offsets that correctly FALL
  BACK. 11 mutants, 9 BITE (2 of those as range errors); **N1_no_reset
  SURVIVES and is reported: the extracted entity has one entry point, so
  llama_top's path-independent `r = 0` reset is invisible here.** Attribution
  control (model replaced by narrow-vs-wide): every kill is attributable to
  the round trip, so the independent model bought nothing against THIS
  mutant set.
- **DERIVED: -1,248,576 cycles a token, 4.15% striped / 2.02% flat**, exact
  arithmetic over the schedule rather than a ratio.
- **THE PATCH IS WRITTEN OUT, NOT APPLIED** -- BENABLE holds
  `rtl/llama_top.vhd`. Five hunks behind `A_DRAIN_WIDE : boolean := false`:
  a group-write region signal `wg_reg`, a `wgmux` on `act_unit` (the same
  rule `elmux` uses), `memp`'s group arm reading `wg_reg`, **`wr_region <=
  wg_reg` so the region LOCK names the region actually written** (without
  this the lever is silently wrong in the guard, not in the data), and the
  wide arm in `S_DRAIN`. All 311 A jobs have `dst_off` in {0, 2048, 4096}
  and `n_rows mod 8 = 0`, MEASURED, so the fallback never runs in the
  shipping schedule.
- **NEXT, ranked:** L2 `gsr` on both group ports + `swiglu_mem` at LANES 8
  (-1,769,472, needs new wide ports on that unit); L3 A's `S_XRD`
  (-1,344,000, but it widens `matvec_int4`'s x bank); L4 `gvr` (-465,920).
  **REJECTED, do not retry:** writing y through during `S_RUN` (only
  +178,368 over L1 and it puts region writes inside the run window); and
  overlapping drain N with XRD N+1 (a `seq_desc_fetch` change, not an
  adapter change). Detail, arithmetic and the full diff in
  `docs/2026-09-20_d-side-vector-traffic.md`.
- **`BASELINE_PASS` was NOT raised** for the new row; it is a floor so the
  gate stays green, and CLAUDE.md's rule against editing `regress.sh` while a
  gate may be live is why. The next full unfiltered gate should raise it by 1.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK SMPWIN: there is NO seam sample window; the chain that IS reachable is CONSTANT on the only reference we have

- **The question was "can the shipping bitstream publish enough of the
  token-0 logit vector through the seam sample window". NO, and the premise
  was wrong.** 0x58/0x5C/0x60 are `WIN_SEL`/`WIN_ADDR`/`WIN_DATA`, the four
  indirect windows (`fk33_seam.vhd:378-380`, `:513-517`). `W_XOUT` reads zero
  (`HOST_WINDOW=false` -> `region_mem.vhd:414`) and the logits never enter a
  region: every `FLG_TO_SMP` job has `dst = R_NONE`
  (`seq_desc_fetch.vhd:502`), and 17,376 rows do not fit `REGMAX = 4096`.
  The sampler's whole surface is ARGMAX 0x44, LOGIT_EXP 0x48, SMP_N 0x64.
  `CAPS_FLAGS = 0x3D`: bit 2 SAMPLER set, **bit 3 LOGITS clear**.
- **Closes LOGITCMP's open item** (prefix argmax under `--upto`): it works as
  derived, and MEASURED it is worth much less than it looked. On `tok0.r9bs`
  the winner 846 is in window 1 and beats every later window's maximum by
  5.17 to 10.21 logits = **16 to 33 INT4 error scales**, so the reference
  chain is the constant 846. 15 GOs = 5.93 s of card time (DERIVED from
  `profile_striped_tok0.txt`, 0.4015 s per token at 75 MHz) to confirm what
  the shipping argmax already reports. **It is a LOCALISER for a disagreement
  that already exists, not a routine check**; `next` bisects in 4 GOs.
- **The finding that changes how SMP_N is read:** the published argmax is
  `sampler_stream`'s own FOLD COUNT (`:51-62`), not `llama_top`'s `smp_idx`,
  which is wired to nothing. A lost beat shifts every later index, so
  `SMP_N == expected` is the condition under which the index means anything.
- **Landed** `84455bf`: `tools/ref9b/smpwin_sweep.py` (9 guards, `--selftest`
  14 mutants 0 fail with an attribution control per firing guard and two
  non-biting rows), `logit_compare.py` PARTIAL-vector support via a
  `LOGITS_ROWS` record (`--partial-selftest` 5 rows 0 fail; the existing
  nine-row table unchanged), `hw/fk33/host/smpwin_sweep_on_card.sh` (refuses
  on `FK33_ALLOW_HARDWARE`, exit 3). Write-up appended to
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-card-cannot-publish-a-logit-vector.md`.
- **No hardware touched. No Vivado run. Peak RSS of anything this track ran:
  75.6 MB.**
- **Next, and it is the operator's call:** run the sweep ONLY if a card
  full-token argmax disagrees with the reference. Otherwise the open items
  worth one GO each are `SMP_N` (must read 248,320), `LOGIT_EXP` and
  `FAULTS` at token 0, none of which has ever been recorded against a
  prediction. A costed logits path (A's output to HBM, one extra master on a
  build that is LUT-bound at 109%) is in section S10 of the write-up.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK BENABLE: B's mover levers are ON in llama_top (`PIPE`, `WIDE`, `MAXOUT => 8`); values bit-identical, DERIVED 8.28 M cycles per token off the card

- **The change is three lines** in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s `u_state` generic
  map, all three generics already existing on `gdn_state_store` and all
  three defaulting to the shipping behaviour. Nothing else in the RTL.
- **`llama_top` feeds THREE generators, not one.** `tools/gen_cardtop.py`
  (`rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`, what the card build compiles) was known;
  `sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py` (`rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd`) was not, and
  `sim:gdnstale` went red on the edit. Both regenerated, `--check` green,
  and `git diff` on each output carries the generic map and nothing else.
  `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` reads the generated top and was unaffected.
- **ACTIVE (MEASURED, BC-250, two isolated trees that `diff -rq` says
  differ in exactly one file):** per-token `cycles elapsed` falls by
  **5,136 x6** (bstate_seq), **7,941 x3** (bconst), **7,704 x2**
  (bstate), while jobs issued, completions, KV records and KV beats are
  identical element for element in both arms.
- **VALUES UNCHANGED:** all four landmarks identical in all three rows in
  both arms (`0 of the pinned landmarks moved`), and for bstate/bstate_seq
  those landmarks are the FLAT arm's, an implementation with no mover in
  it. `sim:seamgate_bconst` PASS on the changed tree checks the nine `R_Y`
  seams bit for bit against `tools/ref9b/gdn_oracle.py`.
- **Gate:** BC-250 `PASS 3 FAIL 0` both arms; workstation `--only gdn`
  PASS 21 / NOCHECK 1, `bmover` 1, `cardtop` 3, `fk33card` 1, `gdnstale`
  1, `seamgate` 6, all FAIL 0.
- **DERIVED for the card:** 660,601 x 0.4778 = 315,633 per job, 8.28 M
  cycles per token (110 ms at 75 MHz), about 27% off the lane-striped
  token. The 2.5% bench-to-card residual is still unexplained and the
  ratio assumes it scales; the additive alternative gives 8.07 M.
- **TRAP, and it voided the first experiment:** another track's
  `bc250-sync-llama-vhdl.sh` overwrote `rtl/llama_top.vhd` on the BC-250
  mid-baseline, because the sync pushes the workstation's WORKING TREE to
  one shared path. One row of that baseline was corrupted and one was
  not. **When a BC-250 measurement depends on an uncommitted file, copy
  the tree under `/home/labuser/` and run there.** Also: the BC-250
  needs `--timeout 3600` for `tb_llama_top_bstate_seq` (1,083 s).
- **NEXT (not this track's files):** routed timing with the levers on, in
  the next `FK33_CARD=1` build; then the three narrow movers' remaining
  90,540 cycles per job (`gdn_conv_tap_mem`, `gdn_conv_w_mem`,
  `gdn_exp_mem`). Detail in
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_b-job-660k-cycles.md`.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK ARENAPLACE: the GDN state is back on segment 27 where the packer puts it, one rule now, and the defect cost at most 2.5% of a B job (DERIVED 0 today)

- **CONFIRMED as STRIPE27 described it.** `.bak-arenas` (the packer) says
  `gdn_state_base 0x1b0000000` segment 27; the live manifest says
  `0x1abde4000` segment 26, with `kv_base 0x1ad71c000` also segment 26.
  26,443,776 B of GDN state and 42,876,928 B = 2,463 tokens of KV in a segment
  six weight lanes have bytes in. **One correction to the census**: it is 198
  tensors with ONE lane in segment 26 and 51 with TWO, not "two per tensor".
- **THE FIX IS ONE RULE, CALLED, NOT RESTATED.** `relayout_arenas()` now calls
  `pack_model_fk33.stripe_context_tokens()` on a striped manifest instead of
  `PK.place()`, and the new `hbm_map.stripe_residency_fails()` (fault P7) is in
  `plan().check()`, so `gen_layer_program.py` and `pack_gdn_consts.py` refuse
  the defective image too. MEASURED: a full repack and the fixed re-layout
  agree to the byte on `gdn_state_base` and `kv_base`. **On a FLAT manifest the
  result is byte-identical to HEAD's**, key for key.
- **TEETH, 29 of 29 in `check_kv_map.py --teeth`.** The mutant is the SHIPPED
  image at its real path: REFUSED on exactly one row. **Attribution control,
  the same image with only the residency rows off: ACCEPTED by all 38
  pre-existing rows**, which is the measurement that none of them could see it.
  One byte below the segment boundary REFUSED, exactly on it accepted, one
  page below REFUSED, `kv_base` alone dragged back REFUSED. **Reported not
  biting, under its own name:** one byte ABOVE the boundary, which is inside a
  reserved segment and costs nothing; its real guard is `hbm_map`'s existing
  4 KB alignment rule, MEASURED firing on it.
- **A HOLE THIS TRACK OPENED AND CLOSED (M-C).** The first fix branched on the
  lane-segment SET being non-empty, so a `lane_stripe` block with an EMPTY
  `segments` list fell through to the 4 KB rule and reproduced the defect
  silently. Branch on the BLOCK's presence; an empty lane plan is now a P7
  fault. An empty set is not evidence of a flat image.
- **THE CORRECTED IMAGE, FOR THE DISPATCHER TO LOAD:**
  `/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen35-9b-mv4i-noembd-striped-seg27`. Same 250
  symlinks, **all 250 per-file blake2b equal to the shipped set and 0 of 250
  `hbm_offset` moved**; `gdn_const.bin` blake2b `ec3eda1a...b917`, equal.
  `gdn_state 0x1b0000000` seg 27, `kv_base 0x1b1938000`, KV spans segments
  27..31, all reserved. `max_context_tokens` 75,181 against the card's
  `C_MAXPOS` 65,536 (read from `gen_fk33_card.py`), margin 1.147x.
  `check_kv_map` 40 rows 0 refused; `check_hbm_stack` PASS. **The token program
  does NOT need regenerating: `.dtbl`, `.rel` AND `.arena` are byte-identical**
  because no weight piece moved and `desc_arena_base` is unchanged.
  `check_kv_map.py`'s DEFAULT striped manifest now points here.
- **MAGNITUDE, DERIVED.** At most **16,429 cycles per B job (2.5%)**, the
  unattributed residual between the card's 660,601 and BMOVER's 644,172, shared
  with three other named candidates; at most 1.3% of a striped token. **And 0
  today**, because D issues steps serially, so no weight lane is active while
  B's mover or C's KV port uses pseudo-channel 26. B asks for a 3.13% duty
  cycle on that PC (68,864 beats x 4.00 ns against an 8.808 ms job), so this
  becomes load-bearing exactly when BMOVER's lever 5 (overlap the state load
  with A) lands. **The flat-vs-striped equality is NOT a control for this:**
  flat puts the state at segment 16, which also holds weights.
- **`check_mv4i_set.py`: recorded, NOT fixed.** Re-MEASURED: 249 FAILURES rc=1
  on BOTH striped sets, PASS on flat. **Nothing in the repo invokes it** (every
  hit outside `.claude/worktrees` is a comment or docstring), so its wrong
  verdict has cost nothing. Making it striping-aware means routing its
  placement, overlap and sub-region rules through `hbm_map.file_pieces()`.
- Write-up: section 10 appended to
  `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_stripe-width-after-the-kv-halved.md` (append only).
  **Trap worth the whole section: a `cp` onto a SYMLINK writes through it and
  silently reverted this track's edits to `tools/hbm_map.py`; `git status`
  showed the file clean.**

### 2026-09-20 TRACK STRIPE27: one lane per pseudo-channel BUYS NOTHING at 75 MHz, and at most 3.2% of a token at 200 MHz. Built anyway, as a measurement image that must not be loaded.

- **The answer, DERIVED.** A pseudo-channel passes one 32 B beat every 4.00 ns
  (STRUCTURAL, `32 B / (32 B x 250 MHz)`), so two lanes get one every 8.00 ns.
  The card's striped A consumes one every **20.40 ns** (MEASURED, 7,931,072
  cycles over 5,184,384 beats at 75 MHz): the supply bound is slack by 12.40 ns
  and **the memory is already idle 61% of the time**. At 200 MHz the demand is
  10.15 ns against the same 8.00 ns, still 21% slack. Halving the bound to
  4.00 ns changes nothing that binds at either clock.
- **AND THE PREMISE WAS WRONG.** The KV halving freed nothing. The packer's bar
  has been `DEFAULT_MIN_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 65536` since 2026-08-30, which is the
  number `C_MAXPOS` was lowered TO; `gen_fk33_card.py`'s own comment says the
  halving was done "so the STRIPED layout fits", i.e. the card was writing a
  131,072-token extent into a layout that yielded 75,340. Re-running the
  identical width search: chosen width `n = 10` before, `n = 10` after.
- **The curve, re-run (MEASURED).** n=12 -> 1 lane/PC, 61.8% fill, 44,432 tok;
  n=11 -> 2, 69.7%, 59,852; **n=10 -> 2, 74.2%, 75,272 (chosen)**; n=9 -> 90,692;
  n=8 -> 106,113; n<=7 REFUSED (segment overflow, then 3+ lanes per PC).
- **The image exists**: `/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen35-9b-mv4i-noembd-stripe27`,
  27 lanes on 27 segments, **max 1 lane per PC on all 249 tensors** (census),
  all 7 stripe checks PASS, `check_hbm_stack` PASS. **250 of 250 blake2b digests
  equal the shipped striped set** while 2,978 of 6,972 pieces moved and 2,534
  changed pseudo-channel: the addresses changed, the values did not.
- **DO NOT LOAD IT.** It yields 44,341 tokens against the card's `C_MAXPOS`
  65,536. `tools/check_kv_map.py --striped-manifest <it>` refuses on 3 rows
  (past `hbm.size`, into `gdn_const`, into `desc_arena`). The boundary is exact:
  `C_MAXPOS=44342` REFUSED, `44341` ACCEPTED. Needs a card at 32,768.
- **NEW REFUSAL in `tools/pack_model_fk33.py`.** `--stripe-min-context` is an
  operator preference; the card's `C_MAXPOS` is a compiled-in extent, and
  nothing connected them, so the packer wrote an unloadable image and reported
  success. Added `scrape_card_maxpos()` (scrapes `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`),
  the refusal, `hbm.card_c_maxpos` / `card_kv_tokens_available` /
  `card_kv_fits`, and `--stripe-allow-under-maxpos`. **Attribution control: the
  same layout with the new check off is accepted rc=0 with 7 of 7 pre-existing
  stripe checks PASS.** Controls: the shipped n=10 and the flat set both re-pack
  byte-identical with `card_kv_fits: true`.
- **A separate defect found on the way, in the LOADED image.**
  `hbm_map.write_arenas()` re-places the GDN state with a 4 KB round-up and
  never reads `lane_stripe`, so it pulled `gdn_state_base` from segment 27 back
  to segment 26 in the shipped striped manifest. 26.4 MB of GDN state and the
  first 2,463 tokens of KV now share pseudo-channel 26 with two weight lanes.
  The packer refuses exactly this placement; the second allocator bypasses it,
  and `check_kv_map` passes it because the bytes do not OVERLAP a piece. Not
  fixed here. Magnitude unmeasured.
- **Token program generated** (`gen_layer_program.py --token --x-exp 0`): the
  `.dtbl` and `.rel` are byte-IDENTICAL to the shipped striped set's and only
  `token.arena` differs (10,376 of 159,232 B), which is the 27 per-lane bases.
- Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_stripe-width-after-the-kv-halved.md`.
  Also REJECTED there: `check_mv4i_set.py` reports **249 FAILURES on the
  SHIPPED striped set too** (v1-only), so its verdict on any striped image
  carries no information.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK LOGITCMP: the logit-level comparison at token 0 CANNOT BE MADE on the shipping bitstream. The whole comparison path is built, teeth-tested and green; the card has no vector to give it.

- **The blocker, three independent reasons, any one sufficient.** (1) The v2
  window seam publishes ARGMAX and LOGIT_EXP and nothing else
  (`rtl/fk33_seam.vhd:91-94`; `pl_backend.c:1243` refuses the request).
  (2) Subsystem A has no HBM write-back for its output -- `y_addr` is a 16-bit
  local bus, and `gen_wb` is the WEIGHT-fetch generate. (3) The region
  read-back window is compiled out: `gen_fk33_card.py` passes
  `HOST_WINDOW=false`, so `hr_data` reads zero. Evidence in the transcript
  itself: `c2h 0` over 182 GOs.
  Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-card-cannot-publish-a-logit-vector.md`.
- **Built anyway, because both halves already existed and only met at a card
  that does not.** `run_prompt --dump-logits <p.r9bs>` writes token 0 as
  `LOGITS` (S32 + shared exponent), `LOGIT_EXP` and `TOKEN` in the EXISTING
  `tools/ref9b` stream format -- `seam_stream.h`'s C writer reused, not
  reimplemented -- so `r9bs.py` and `check_token.py` read it unchanged.
  `tools/ref9b/logit_compare.py` adds what neither owns: ranks, top-k overlap,
  the best-fit scale, the residual distribution and a **per lm_head window**
  breakdown over the 15 shards. MEASURED against the simulated v1 card at the
  real 9B shape: 0.18 s, 60 MB.
- **On a v2 card it reports UNAVAILABLE and exits 2, never 0.** That took three
  attempts to get right and is the part most likely to have been wrong
  silently.
- **New gate row `sim:logitcmp`**, self-contained (no GGUF, no manifest, no
  capture, no card): 9 mutations of a synthetic 248,320-element dump scored PER
  FIELD, with `check_token.py` as the attribution control on every row.
  MEASURED 3.0 s, 75 MB, `OVERALL PASS 1`. Two mutants deliberately DO NOT
  bite: `common` (an error both inputs share -- the resolution floor) and
  `tokenbias` (check_token's kill by construction). Teeth on the teeth: two
  mutants of the comparator itself fail exactly one row each.
- **The operator procedure is `hw/fk33/host/logit_compare_on_card.sh`**, which
  prints its commands and refuses to touch hardware (exit 3 if
  `FK33_ALLOW_HARDWARE` is in the environment). `--check` verifies every
  precondition that does not need the card. **Use the one-id prompt 248045**,
  not the DC-DC prompt: the existing reference capture is that id (its own log,
  `argmax=846 logit=12.782196`, matching the record's `max=+12.7822`).
- **NEXT, for whoever picks this up.** Either (a) record `SMP_N`, `LOGIT_EXP`
  and the argmax at token 0 on the one-id prompt, which runs today and is
  unmeasured, or (b) decide whether a logits-DMA bitstream is worth a build.
  The host half is already written and tested.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK ACLK (verification pass): the A clock-domain split is VERIFIED to the limit of what runs without synthesis. Byte-identity OFF holds; `--bd-only` with the switch ON PASSES on the BC-250 WITH an OFF control beside it; `sim:runguard` goes RED if the switch is exported without `FK33_CARD=1`.

- The first attempt committed `99e5d99` / `886ebc0` / `11a4d6a` and was
  rate-limited before reporting ANY verification. Everything below was re-run
  from scratch, not inherited. Appended as section 9 of
  `docs/2026-09-20_a-clock-domain-split.md` (pure append, 346 lines).
- **Byte-identity OFF: MEASURED.** Regenerated with `FK33_CARD=1
  FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75`, both SHA256 unchanged,
  `git diff` empty, rc=0 checked BEFORE the diff was believed. **Teeth added:**
  in a throwaway worktree, OFF vs ON differ by 177 tcl lines and 9 xdc lines,
  so the identity test is not passing because the switch does nothing.
- **Gate rows, seven each column.** OFF: `tb_eng_cdc` 1, `seamgate` 6,
  `cardtop` 3, `fk33card` 1, `runguard` 1, `bdports` 1, `srvseam` 1, all
  `REGRESSION: PASS`. ON: identical **except `runguard` PASS 0 FAIL 1**.
- **That red row is the generator's own guard, not a defect.** `sim:runguard`
  runs `gen_pcieep.py --selftest` with no `FK33_CARD`, which is the one
  configuration the split refuses (`ABORT: FK33_ENG_SPLIT_CLK=1 without
  FK33_CARD=1`). With both exported the row PASSES (MEASURED). Section 6's
  "runguard PASS 1 / PASS 1" is **withdrawn as written** -- true only for an ON
  column that also sets `FK33_CARD=1`, which was not stated. **The switch is
  not composable with a whole-gate run**; open for a decision, not changed.
- **`--bd-only` ON, on the BC-250, WITH THE OFF CONTROL.** Lane gated on
  PRESENCE by `/proc/PID/exe`, address re-resolved from the router lease,
  tree synced first. Both runs: `FK33_BD_ONLY_DONE` x2, `FK33_BD_VALIDATE OK`
  x2, `FK33_UNCONNECTED count=0`, `^ERROR:` 0, zero REAL `41-759`, peak
  3.8 GB under a 6G cap. **The split adds exactly four CRITICAL WARNINGs**
  (`BD 41-737` read-only on `eng_cdc`'s clock/reset pins) against 3 of the
  identical class already in the shipped OFF build. Everything else in the
  census is unchanged, including the 32 pre-existing `41-1377`.
  It ANSWERS section 8's open packager question: `sa`/`ma` ARE inferred as
  AXI-Lite and the two-hop 256-byte assignment resolves.
- **The 41-759 count is the log-contains-its-own-script trap again.** An
  unanchored `grep -c` says 1; the hit is `pcieep_build.sh`'s echoed source.
  Real Vivado messages: **0**.
- **Mutants: 15 of 15 as expected**, both attribution controls biting (W12/W34
  for the redundant wait pairs, G2 for G1). Seven survivors reported under
  their own names with the real guard for each. The bench already drives BOTH
  ratios (13.333/5 then swapped 5/13.333, periods are signals), 11,678 checks
  counted in variables, so the one-ratio objection does not apply.
- **Constraints, anchored.** `^set_clock_groups .*-asynchronous` 2 -> 3;
  `^set_max_delay .*-datapath_only` **0 in both**; no `if` in the file, so the
  XDC reader cannot skip the block. The missing max-delay is DELIBERATE -- a
  clock group is a false path and outranks a max-delay exception -- but the
  consequence is real and now recorded: **nothing bounds routed skew on the
  crossing**, justified by precedent only.
- **Projection re-derived; section 7 reproduces EXACTLY** (striped 0.4015 ->
  0.3484 s, 1.15x). **At 200 MHz A is datapath-bound, not memory-bound:** one
  PC gives 32 B per ACLK cycle at 250 MHz = 4.0 ns/beat, 2 lanes per PC = 8.0
  ns/lane-beat = 1.60 cycles at 200 MHz, against a measured 2.03, so **21% of
  the busiest PC's supply is still unused**. **CORRECTION:** section 7's flat
  row used an unsourced 108 ns/beat and so projected flat getting SLOWER than
  measured; the profile's own arithmetic gives **102.16 ns/beat**, flat token
  0.8254 s, **1.00x**. Conclusion unchanged, number corrected.
- **The post-split token depends on B.** B is MEASURED at 660,601 cycles/job
  (52.6% of a striped token); another track's levers project ~308k (ESTIMATE).
  DERIVED: split alone 1.15x, B alone 1.39x, **both 1.70x (0.2356 s)**. If B
  lands first the A split's share RISES from 15% to 23%.
- **A trap worth knowing: `gen_pcieep.py` is NOT path-portable.** It ABORTs
  from any checkout that is not `/home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl`, because
  a guard compares an absolute path baked into `build_fk33_i2cprobe.tcl`.
  Harmless today only because `bc250-sync-llama-vhdl.sh`'s `DEST` happens to
  be exactly that path. Third file with this trap.
- **NOT DETERMINED:** anything needing synthesis or routing (timing, area,
  `report_cdc`, `FK33_ENGSPLIT`, the 44 RAMB36 y FIFO, `clk_wiz_0`'s four
  outputs from one VCO); the routed skew; why Vivado refuses `ASSOCIATED_RESET`
  on `eng_cdc`; `seamgate`'s six rows are unattributable because another track
  was editing `rtl/swiglu_mem.vhd` while they compiled; and the projection is
  still cross-build arithmetic until the card's own counters are read at
  200 MHz.
- **No hardware was touched and no Vivado ran on the workstation** (a card
  build held its lane throughout).

### 2026-09-20 TRACK SWGFAST: LANDED at `7ed6535`. VEC_SWG's 5.0 cycles/element is 1+1+2+1 (G load, U load, the unit's two passes, write-back). `swiglu_mem` gains LANES (default 1); at LANES = 4 the unit is 6,157 cycles instead of 24,588 -- which is 30% of the VEC_SWG step and **0.95% of a token**. NEEDS ONE LINE IN llama_top TO REACH THE CARD. NEVER SYNTHESISED.

- **Accounting** (docs/debugging/2026-09-20_vec-swg-5-cycles-per-element.md):
  the unit is 2N + 12 = 24,588 (MEASURED, `SWGFAST_CYCLES` in
  sim/tb_swiglu_mem.vhd); llama_top's `gsr` adds N+2 for each of G, U and
  the write-back. DERIVED 61,459 against the card's 61,473; VEC_NORM leaves
  the identical 14-cycle residual (unit 3,125 MEASURED `NORMFAST_CYCLES`,
  11,322 against 11,336). Neither unit has a per-element multi-cycle loop.
- **Change:** `rtl/swiglu_mem.vhd` LANES generic (banks, per-lane pipeline,
  per-lane running max + one S_MAX state above LANES = 1). MEASURED
  24,588 / 12,301 / 6,157 at N = 12288 for LANES 1/2/4. Identity re-run with
  the CURRENT bench in all six arms (the first pass's dumps predated the
  lane-stress trials): HEAD-unit vs LANES 1/2/4 at N = 128 AND N = 12288,
  **6 of 6 `cmp` IDENTICAL** (3,741 and 233,491 lines). DERIVED step
  61,473 -> 49,186 (-20%) / 43,042 (-30%). Mutation table 19 rows x 3 LANES
  (`bankswap`, the swapped bank/offset split, added), 0 unexpected. Gate
  re-run after the last edit: tb_swiglu_mem(+_9b) PASS 2,
  tb_rmsnorm_bf_mem PASS 1, tb_llama_top_swg PASS 1, seamgate_swg PASS 1.
- **What it is actually worth, and this is the number to quote:** VEC_SWG is
  **3.18%** of a flat token (1,967,136 of 61,907,125 cycles; A_JOB is 68.95%,
  B_JOB 25.61%). LANES = 2 removes 0.64% of a token, LANES = 4 removes
  **0.95%**. The unit gets 4x faster and the token gets about one percent
  faster; only the second is a result. 3N of the 5N is the adapter and no
  generic on this unit can reach it.
- **NEVER SYNTHESISED, at any LANES.** No Vivado ran for this change. The
  area figures in hw/fk33/results/swgmem_2026-09-19/ are the PRE-change unit,
  so LANES 2/4 area is ESTIMATE and even LANES = 1 has not been re-drawn.
  Weigh an UNMEASURED DSP/LUT cost against under one percent of a token
  before building anything.
- **Two planted trials** (`one_big0..3`, `one_big_last`) were added because
  `lanemax` survived at LANES = 4 and `nodrain` had never bitten. A second
  attribution control (mutants against HEAD's trial set) says the new trials
  earned exactly **4 kills of 24 rows**: `nodrain` at all three LANES and
  `lanemax` at LANES = 4. An older random trial already caught every other
  lane mutant.
- **Trap recorded:** this track's earlier WORKLOG entry was committed by
  TRACK ACLK's `11a4d6a` (pathspec commit on a shared file captures the
  working tree). Recorded, not amended.
- **`rmsnorm_bf_mem` unchanged:** its unit share is 27.6% of VEC_NORM.
- **NEXT (not this track's files):** `rtl/llama_top.vhd` generic
  `SWG_LANES : positive := 1` beside NORM_LANES and
  `generic map(N => NN, Q => 12, LANES => SWG_LANES)` in `gsr`;
  `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` `--generic SWG_LANES=2` (conservative) or 4.
  Area above LANES = 1 is ESTIMATE (+16 DSP, +2.3 k LUT per lane); the
  OOC draw on the BC-250 is `sim/ooc_swgmem_run.sh`'s `draw` with
  `"N=12288 Q=12 LANES=4"`. The other 3N per step is the adapter's serial
  region-file traffic (one word per cycle each way) and is a llama_top /
  sequencer lever, listed in the write-up.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK ACLK: the A clock-domain split is in the tree behind `FK33_ENG_SPLIT_CLK=1` (default OFF, byte-identical when off). Bench + 15 mutants green. DERIVED: 1.15x per striped token, 1.0x on the flat image. NOT YET BUILT.

Oren's question: "can we not clock the blocks that have more cycles faster?"
Answer for A, and the contract, in `docs/2026-09-20_a-clock-domain-split.md`.

**What landed** (`99e5d99`, `886ebc0`):
- `rtl/fk33_eng_cdc.vhd`: the seam cell between `card` (75 MHz clk_out3) and
  `eng` (new clk_out4 at `FK33_ENG_FAST_MHZ`, default 200). Every
  `CARD_SEAM_TO_ENG`/`FROM_ENG` net and the card's AXI-Lite write master
  cross through it. x and y are `rtl/async_fifo.vhd` (y sized to a whole job,
  256 beats = 44 RAMB36); the AXI-Lite write is a toggle handshake carrying
  `a_x_exp`/`a_job_index` with it; **done crosses as a rising-edge EVENT
  cleared by the next accepted write, not as a level**, because
  `a_desc_adapter`'s S_WAIT argument is "the GO that put us here cleared
  done_l" and a level synchroniser would hand it the previous job's done.
  Three orderings the single-clock card relied on are enforced by handshake
  on both sides (x before the first write; done never stale; every y beat
  before done).
- `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`: the switch, `fast_reset` (ext_reset_in =
  xdma/axi_aresetn, so `check_reset_topology`'s descendancy rule still holds
  and its nine teeth rows pass retargeted), `axil2eng`/`engctl` at NUM_CLKS 3,
  the `eng_cdc` cell and its wiring, the two-hop address map, one
  `set_clock_groups -asynchronous` line with a sentinel, `check_cdc_pins`
  (48 pins, teeth on each face), live-cell `FK33_ENGCDC`, implemented-design
  `FK33_ENGSPLIT` (distinct clocks, >= 10 ASYNC_REG cells under
  `bd_i/eng_cdc`, `report_cdc` both ways), `split_gate_teeth`.
- **The 28 HBM masters are not touched.** They already run on `hbm_aclk` =
  xdma/axi_aclk at 250 MHz with the crossing inside `axi_rd_port`, exactly as
  the engine-only 200 MHz build; the split moves ONE engine clock pin.

**MEASURED:**
- `sim:tb_eng_cdc` OVERALL PASS 1 (11,678 checks; 13.333/5 ns, swapped
  5/13.333 ns with a 12-element tail burst, both overflow faults, sticky err).
- `sim/mutate_eng_cdc.sh`: 15 of 15 as expected. Killed: both-halves x wait
  (W12), both-halves y wait (W34), done not cleared by a write (W5), done as a
  LEVEL (W6), gray encoder only (G2), late full flag (F1, ABORT). Survivors,
  stated as the floor: each single half of a redundant wait (W1-W4), one-flop
  sync (W7), same-edge toggle (W8), binary pointers (G1), early full (F2).
  W12 SURVIVED the first bench: the request path's own latency exceeds the x
  FIFO's at either ratio; the tail burst made the ordering reachable.
- Switch off: regenerate with `FK33_CARD=1 FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed
  FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75`, `git diff` on the tcl and xdc EMPTY. `--selftest`
  PASS in all four configurations. `sim:runguard` PASS 1 / PASS 1,
  `sim:cardtop` PASS 3 / PASS 3, `sim:fk33card` PASS 1 / PASS 1 (off / on).
- On the way: `async_fifo`'s read side pops 2 beats per 3 rclk cycles with
  `q_ready` high (`do_rd` gated on `ocnt + inflight < 2`).

**DERIVED, from the token-0 profiles and the manifest shapes:** an `A_JOB`
step is 27.2% card-side (x push `K+2` and drain `M` at the card clock,
2,963,566 cycles) and 72.8% engine-side (7,931,072 cycles over ~5.18 M beats
= **1.53 cycles/beat, the datapath floor: at 75 MHz the striped A is
compute-bound**). The 200 MHz engine-only build measured 2.03 cycles/beat on
the same striping = 10.15 ns/beat, against the busiest-PC (2 lanes) supply
bound of 8.0 ns/beat = 1.6 cycles at 200 MHz: within 21% of the memory bound.
Token: striped **0.4015 s -> 0.3484 s (1.15x)**, A 0.1453 -> 0.0921 s; flat
0.8254 -> ~0.83 s (the single-PC bound is clock-independent). By cycles B is
the bigger block (52.6%) but its fmax is unmeasured; A's 200 MHz is.

**NOT done:** any Vivado run. The BC-250 lane had one Vivado present
(3.75 GB RSS) when checked, so `--bd-only` with the switch on is the next
step (3 min, 3.4 GB): it answers whether the packager infers `sa`/`ma` as
write-only AXI4-Lite compatible with `card/a` and `engctl/S01`, and whether
`eng_cdc/sa/reg0` exists. Then a routed card build with
`FK33_ENG_SPLIT_CLK=1` (start at `FK33_ENG_FAST_MHZ=175` if 200 fails) reads
`FK33_ENGSPLIT`, the two `report_cdc` files and `fk33_pcieep_engcdc_util.rpt`.

### 2026-09-20 TRACK KVREG: subsystem C's KV base is a SEAM REGISTER, not a generic. C_MAXPOS halved to 65536 so the striped image fits. Host refuses an unfit manifest. NOT YET BUILT.

- **Defect** (docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-kv-cache-base-is-compiled-into-
  the-bitstream.md): `C_K_BASE_CH`/`C_V_BASE_CH` were compiled from the
  FLAT manifest; the striped image's kv_base is elsewhere and C wrote 40
  weight objects. **Fix, landed in this track:** `rtl/llama_top.vhd` gains
  input ports `kv_k_base`/`kv_v_base` (byte addresses, defaulting to the
  compiled pair, so every bench is unchanged) handed straight to
  `attn_kv_axi`; `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd` gains **A_KVK_LO/HI 0x90/0x94,
  A_KVV_LO/HI 0x98/0x9C (RW, reset 0, in the GO-time zero refusal with
  ARENA/BST) and A_KV_MAXPOS 0xA0 (RO, the seam's MAXPOS generic, which
  gen_pcieep.py sets from gen_fk33_card.py's C_MAXPOS)**; CAPS bit 5
  (`FK33_CAP_ENG_KV_BASE`, 0x1D -> 0x3D). gen_pcieep SEAM_TO_CARD wires
  both; gen_fk33_card sets **C_MAXPOS=C_CTXLEN=65536, C_V_BASE_CH=318324224**
  (2*65536*8704 = 1.14 GB fits the striped image's 1.378 GB free; 131072
  needs 2.28 GB and does not). All four generated files regenerated.
- **Host:** `pl_backend.c` reads KV_MAXPOS, programs K = hbm.kv_base and
  V = K + MAXPOS*8704, reads all four back, and REFUSES an image whose free
  KV space (below gdn_const/the arena) cannot hold the pair. MEASURED on the
  simulated card with the real striped manifest: `--sim-kv-maxpos 131072`
  refused ("903618560 bytes short"), 65536 programmed K 0x1AD71C000 /
  V 0x1CF71C000. Without the caps bit it prints that the base is compiled
  in and continues. `fk33ctl.py seam` prints the pair or UNREADABLE.
- **Gates:** `sim:kvmap` now checks BOTH manifests' KV extent at the card's
  C_MAXPOS against every weight piece and the gdn_state/gdn_const/arena
  regions; the teeth row "striped image with the compiled flat pair at
  131072" REFUSES naming `output.weight.mv4i lane 15 seg 17`, and its
  attribution control (extent rows off) is ACCEPTED, i.e. the old rows were
  blind. New bench row `sim:tb_llama_top_kvport` (decoy generics, real
  bases on the ports; landmarks identical to tb_llama_top_seq); tb_fk33_seam
  P6g (17 checks). Mutants: A (seam never latches) fails P6g 8-13, 17 by
  name; B (engine port map back to the constants) see the report.
- **NEXT: a card build** (`FK33_CARD=1`, ~47 GB with swap, alone on the
  box) and, on silicon, `fk33ctl.py seam` must show caps 0x3D and the pair
  after `run_prompt --open-only`; then the striped image's token 0 argmax
  must be 846 and `fk33_load_weights.py verify` clean AFTER the token.
  Until that bitstream exists the shipped `.bit` still has the base
  compiled in and must only be run with the flat image.

### 2026-09-20 03:05: THE CARD ANSWERS THE PROMPT. Qwen3.5-9B on the FK33, 23-token prefill + 160 generated tokens, no faults, first token = reference.

- Bitstream `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_swg_75mhz_2026-09-20.bit` (sha256
  8257e25c..., from `8dbe160`/`e40067f`: seq_rst + `rmsnorm_bf_mem` +
  `swiglu_mem`, every stand-in gone). The synthesised netlist (362,195 LUT,
  82.4%, SMALLER than the previous card: the stub's 1,152 LUTRAM blocks
  left with the real SwiGLU) failed to route TWICE from the same
  placement: `Congestion_SpreadLogic_high` 209 unrouted / 121 overlaps,
  then `route_design -directive AlternateCLBRouting` on the same
  placement gave the SAME 209 / 121 to the digit (MEASURED: a route
  directive cannot fix a placement-bound overlap). Re-implemented from
  the synth checkpoint with `place_design -directive ExtraNetDelay_high`:
  routed, WNS +0.050, no congestion report. Evidence and the Tcl in
  `hw/fk33/results/card_swg_2026-09-20/`. **A card build's placement is a
  draw: two of five draws failed today; re-implement from the DCP with a
  different placer directive rather than resynthesising (47 GB, 1 h).**
- MEASURED on silicon (`dcdc_prompt_160.txt` in that directory):
  `prefill 23 ids, first argmax 1206` = the reference's first token;
  divergence at token 1 (4087 "To answer" vs 3418 "To understand"),
  thereafter a coherent, correct answer: "DC-DC converters and
  transformers operate on different principles ... Transformers work by
  electromagnetic induction and only work with AC ... DC-DC converters
  take DC as input ... a DC-DC converter typically uses a transformer
  internally (via a switching mechanism like PWM)". 182 positions, KV
  cache and GDN state across tokens, faults 0, ~0.8 s/token at 75 MHz.
- Token-level agreement with the BF16 reference beyond token 0 is NOT
  expected and was not the goal: INT4 weights + Q12 fixed point on the
  card against BF16/double, and greedy decoding amplifies any early
  difference. The next measurement is a logit-level comparison at token 0
  (the card's full logits row vs the reference's) to quantify the
  arithmetic gap, then speed.

### 2026-09-19 08:10: TWO ROOT CAUSES ON SILICON IN ONE MORNING. B WAS NEVER RUNNING TOKEN 0, AND THE NORM CLAMPS ON THE EMBEDDING. seq_rst LANDED (`1b8d28f`) AND IS BUILDING; THE NORM PORT IS IN FLIGHT.

- **ROOT CAUSE 1 (`1b8d28f`, docs/debugging/2026-09-19_b-ran-every-probe-token-as-not-the-first.md)**:
  the card's `tok_pos` advances on every closed token and was cleared ONLY
  by the PCIe link reset; the seam's SEQ_RESET cleared its own `cur_pos`
  and nothing in the engine (`run_prompt.c:343` said so in a comment).
  Every B-reaching probe after the first token ran at `tk0 = 0` against a
  zero loaded state, the update quantiser chose `e_u = se_j + 2 = 2`, and
  Y came out at exponent 10 / attn_gate argmax 2591. MEASURED by reading
  layer-0 S back from HBM (`fk33ctl.dma_read` at `gdn_state_base`):
  mantissas 0/-1 at a uniform exponent 2, and the model with tk0 forced
  to 0 reproduces 507,460 of 524,288 mantissas, the exponent and the
  argmax. After one reconfiguration, the first token gives **2131, the
  reference**. Fix: `llama_top.seq_rst` (clears tok_pos, re-arms KV seq
  reset), seam SEQ_RESET idle-only and pulsing `d_seq_rst`, `A_TOK_POS`
  0x8C, CAPS bit 4, host readback in `pl_seq_reset`, `tb_fk33_seam` P6f
  (9 checks; two mutants killed by name). `--bd-only` validates,
  FK33_UNCONNECTED count=0. **Building as `seqrst-build.service`
  (launched 07:39, MemoryHigh 24G / Max 26G, `$SD/build6/`), swap guard
  kills it at 30 GB.** MEASURED: its cgroup is 23.5 GB resident + 23.9 GB
  SWAPPED in synthesis = a 47 GB footprint; "at least 21.5 GB" in CLAUDE.md
  under-states it by half because swap was never counted.
- **HBM does NOT survive a reconfiguration** (MEASURED: gdn_const verify
  fails 0x751 bytes in). A reload costs the weight load (~4.5 GB, 251/251
  in a few minutes), not just 2 minutes.
- **ROOT CAUSE 2 (`573b677`, docs/debugging/2026-09-19_the-embedding-sits-below-the-norms-window.md)**:
  with a true first token, B's input (the tap column) is 0.7727x the
  reference for q, k AND v at corr 0.999. X scaled by 4: unchanged; by
  1/4: 0.9774x. `rmsnorm_rs_mem` (still the norm in `llama_top:2571`)
  floors the mean square at 2^-12, rms 2^-6; the embedding row's rms is
  2^-6.35. The 08-26 fix `rmsnorm_bf` has no `_mem` variant and was never
  composed in. **A subagent (worktree) is porting it: `rmsnorm_bf_mem`,
  identity bench, top swap, `vec_oracle.norm_bf`, gate rows after the
  build ends, OOC on the BC-250.** This needs a THIRD build after the
  seqrst one.
- **10:45 UPDATE: the norm port LANDED (`3527c44` `feb84b1` `b601ca8`,
  merged fast-forward).** `rtl/rmsnorm_bf_mem.vhd` behind rs_mem's ports;
  identity bench 1,822 checks bit-exact incl. the x_exp 19 embedding case;
  10 mutants bite, 4 survive by name (`owe_norst`, `xwswap`,
  `transpose_all`, `align_rnd`); `vec_oracle.norm_bf` 220/220 bit-exact
  against the C oracle, and `--norm real` now means bf; `llama_top` binds
  it (`done` +1 cycle, 149 vs 148). OOC on the BC-250 at N=4096: 4,995 LUT
  / 2,411 FF / 6 BRAM / 40 DSP / WNS +0.971 against rs_mem 4,825 / 1,629 /
  6 / 40 / +0.971 (control reproduced the 08-30 draw to the digit). Gate on
  the BC-250: seamgate 5/5, tb_llama_top 10/10 (one row needs
  `--timeout 2400` there), cardtop 3/3, tb_fk33_seam 2/2, no golden moved
  (DERIVED: no bench-shape vector reaches the clamp region; open item).
  **The BC-250 runs llama_top-level rows now**: GHDL 6.0.0 refused
  `axi_rd_port.vhd:260`, fixed in `0f6b82c` on both GHDL versions.
  **The norm build is ARMED behind the seqrst build** (`$SD/build7/arm.sh`,
  unit `norm-build`, same caps, own swap guard) at HEAD `b601ca8`.
- **11:46: THE SEQRST BUILD DID NOT ROUTE.** `Route 35-162`: 9,293 signals
  unrouted, 7,871 node overlaps, congestion 85-88% in all four directions,
  bitgen not run. Same strategy (`Congestion_SpreadLogic_high`) as the four
  card builds that routed with no congestion report at all; LUT 83.74%
  against 83.47%. A placement draw, not a size change (the 08-30
  scatter-per-draw doc). Log and placed utilization kept in
  `hw/fk33/results/card_seqrst_2026-09-19_ROUTEFAIL/`; the synth DCP is in
  `$SD/build6/root` for a re-implementation if the norm draw also fails.
  **The norm build (unit `norm-build`, launched 11:47 by the arm script on
  the unit ending) carries seq_rst too and supersedes it; running.**
  Oren has authorised the main session to reload bitstreams itself
  (sudoless `fk33_reload.sh` via `/usr/local/sbin/fk33-pci`, `f5ec164`).
- **16:02: THE NORM BUILD ROUTED (WNS +0.054, no congestion report) and is
  ON THE CARD**: `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_seqrst_bfnorm_75mhz_2026-09-19.bit`
  (sha256 f6c89e4f..., from `b601ca8`), results in
  `hw/fk33/results/card_seqrst_bfnorm_2026-09-19/`. Reloaded sudoless
  (first use of `fk33-pci`; its `lsmod | grep -q` misread under pipefail,
  fixed to capture-then-test). MEASURED on silicon: `attn_gate(Y)` = 2131
  on TWO consecutive runs with `--seq-reset` between (was 2591 on the
  second before), `engine tok_pos` reads back 0 after the reset, and
  `logit_exp` moved 19 -> 18 (Y grew, the norm fix). Token 0 end to end:
  no faults, 504 steps, **argmax 247749 against the reference 846**.
- **ROOT CAUSE 3 (docs/debugging/2026-09-19_the-swiglu-on-the-card-is-a-product-with-no-gate.md)**:
  bisecting XN entering each block with `hw/fk33/host/fk33_bisect_layers.sh`
  (probes are free now): blocks 0-2 right, first DIFF entering block 4;
  inside block 3 C's Y is RIGHT (attn_output 3456 = ref), G and U are
  right, `ffn_down(H)` is wrong with H at exponent 9 vs 13 (block 0: 10 vs
  14, argmax survived by luck). **`rtl/llama_top.vhd:1832`: the D-vec
  SwiGLU is the behavioural `g*u/2^16` with no silu, in every
  configuration; `rtl/swiglu.vhd` has no D-vec adapter.** The last
  stand-in in the composed top (the banner's "ATTENTION IS A STUB" line is
  stale: C is real and measured right). **Adapter track dispatched 16:40
  (worktree): `swiglu_mem` + `gsr`/`SWG_REAL` + `vec_oracle.swg_real` +
  `seamgate_swg` + OOC on the BC-250.** Fourth build after it lands.
- **18:00: THE SWIGLU ADAPTER LANDED (`6ebc2d5`, merged `8dbe160`) AND
  THE FOURTH BUILD IS RUNNING** (unit `swg-build`, `$SD/build8/`, same
  caps and guards, HEAD `8dbe160`, `SWG_REAL=true` in the card generics,
  51 card sources). MEASURED by the track: `swiglu_mem` bit-identical to
  the shipping `swiglu -> vec_mem -> bfp_pack` chain at N=12288 (184,336
  checks), 9 of 12 mutants bite (non-biting by name: `nodrain`, `nosat`,
  `doneearly`), `vec_oracle.swg_real` vs the double-precision R_H-3 corr
  0.999996 (Q12 grid is the limiting term), `seamgate_swg` 64 seams x 3
  tokens bit-exact with both controls failing at R_H-0; gate groups all
  green on both boxes; OOC at N=12288 +2,493 LUT / 19.5 BRAM / 16 DSP,
  +4.664 ns at 13.333 ns. The banner's "ATTENTION IS A STUB" line was
  stale and is fixed. `regress.sh`'s rc grep gained `-a` (a NUL-holed log
  had hidden an rc line).
- **The DC-DC prompt ran end to end on the seqrst+bfnorm card** (23-token
  prefill + 16 generated, 39 positions through 32 blocks, no faults,
  ~0.8 s/token): text is nonsense, first divergence at token 0, as
  expected with every FFN at `g*u`. Same command is the test after the
  swg build.
- **Still open**: the first-token whole-token argmax 0 / logit exp -25.
  The seqrst bitstream makes B-reaching probes free again (no reload per
  probe), which is what the bisection needs.
- **BC-250**: up, synced, Vivado present, **no GHDL**; it can take OOC
  synthesis, not gate rows.

### 2026-09-19 00:20: THE LAST STAND-IN IS GONE AT THE SIM SHAPE. FULL GATE 145 PASS. THE CONSTANTS BUILD IS ARMED BEHIND THE ROUTER.

- **Track F (`3fdfe8f`, `d93a745`, merged)**: `C_QKN_IMAGE` on `llama_top`,
  the model's PER-LAYER `attn_q_norm`/`attn_k_norm` gains (8 layers x 2 x
  256 at 9B, `hw/fk33/gen/qkn_9b.hex`; `C_QKN_EXP` stays 12, largest
  mantissa 11,968 MEASURED) selected by the C job's layer, pinned two-sided
  to `2 * n_attn_blocks` at elaboration. MEASURED at the sim shape:
  `R_Y-3` bit for bit at tokens 0/1/2 with the image model, and the ramp
  model FAILS the same capture at 8/63/64 of 64 mantissas; at 2 attention
  layers, 6 of 6 with the image and 0 of 6 for each of ramp / layers
  swapped / q-k swapped. Rows `sim:qknimage`, `sim:tb_llama_top_qkn`,
  `sim:seamgate_qkn`. Empty default leaves `tb_llama_top_real`'s four
  landmarks unmoved. Card generics now carry `C_QKN_IMAGE`.
  **So every learned constant the design consumes is now the model's**, at
  least where a bench can see it: A's weights (descriptors), the D-vec norm
  gains (image), B's taps/alpha/beta (regions), B's conv weights/dt/a/ssm
  norm (HBM `gdn_const`), C's QK-norm gains (image).
- **Gate rows for B** (`252b4f6` `220d3b7` `4e14b4c`): `sim:gdnconst`,
  `sim:constimage`, `sim:tb_llama_top_bconst`, `sim:seamgate_bconst` (9 of
  9 R_Y, floor 61 + RY_FLOOR 9; control 0 of 9). The capture file list had
  been missing `gdn_conv_w_mem.vhd` since `e212f04`, which had turned
  `seamgate_{real,stub,seq}` red unheard; fixed there.
- **Full gate at `1abb514`, `--jobs 1`, MEASURED: 145 PASS, 2 FAIL**, both
  `--check` rows stale from track D's own edits (`sim:gdnstale`:
  `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` is extracted from `gb_real`; `sim:cardtop`:
  `tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd` is derived from `tb_llama_top.vhd` by
  `gen_cardtop.py --bench`). Regenerated in `3b61938`/`907918a`; both read
  OK. The generator-input trap in CLAUDE.md, again, and again caught only
  by the `--check` rows. `BASELINE_PASS` stays 130 (this tree carries 22
  rows a clean checkout does not get).
- **Memory incident avoided**: the 9B-geometry store bench sat at its 8 GB
  cap beside the 15 GB router and swap went 7 -> 15 GB in an hour; stopped
  by PID (`/proc/PID/exe`), swap back to 7 GB at once. Its appetite is
  > 8 GB and UNKNOWN (a capped `memory.peak` is the cap); rerun when the
  box is quiet. The reference `llama-server` on 8140 is stopped.
- **The constants build is armed** (`$SD/build5/arm.sh`): chained on the
  maxpos build's own `FK33_BUILD_DONE`, then a `/proc/PID/exe` presence
  check, then `const-build.service` at `MemoryHigh=20G`, same recipe. It
  takes the tree at launch, i.e. HEAD `907918a` with all of the above.
  BD validated on the BC-250 with the new seam wire.

### 2026-09-18 23:00: THE B CONSTANTS PATH IS IN THE TREE. AT THE SIM SHAPE, B NOW COMPUTES THE MODEL'S ARITHMETIC: 9 OF 9 R_Y SEAMS OVER 3 TOKENS, BIT FOR BIT, WITH BOTH CONTROLS AT 0 OF 9

Four tracks plus the dispatcher's, all landed between 22:00 and 23:00
(`18d5864` contract; A `e212f04`; B `2177bee` `0126c24` `4c1c4cd`; C
`7430bae` `f212358` `d3c043b` `ff8ff6b`; E `39b1992` `ee42054`; D
`f425d82`; card regen `14289cf`). `docs/2026-09-18_b-constants-path.md` is
the contract and was corrected in place by the tracks where the build
differed.

What exists now:

- **HBM region `gdn_const`**, 66,048 B per GDN layer x 24 = 1,585,152 B at
  `hbm.gdn_const_base = 0x1FF95A000` (ends at the descriptor arena; nothing
  placed moved; `max_context_tokens` 233,638 -> 233,237). Image
  `/mnt/storage/llama-models/qwen35-9b-mv4i-noembd/gdn_const.bin`, blake2b
  `ec3eda1a…`, `--check` PASS; the packer's selftest catches 7 of 8 mutant
  packers (`round_half_up` is the named non-biter). Per-layer exponents:
  conv 14..17, dt 10..12, a 8..17, norm 14..15; the units accept those
  ranges (checked: `to_q_wide`, `rsh_r`, `gdn_conv`'s `e_acc`, `rmsnorm_rs`).
- **`gdn_state_store`'s fourth, load-only phase** into the new
  `gdn_conv_w_mem` (KCONV slots, no rotation) plus a scalar register file;
  9,475 checks at the sim shape, 7 mutants of which 6 bite (M7, a dead
  clamp, is unobservable by design; M6 bites by ONE check, attribution
  control run). `CONST_EN = false` is bit-identical to before.
- **Seam registers 0x84/0x88** (`bst_const_base`), host define, sim model,
  `fk33ctl seam`, drift check 55 rows; `pl_backend` writes it from the
  manifest; the host loader loads and verifies the image.
- **`llama_top` `B_CONST_HBM`**: conv weights, dt, a, ssm_norm and their
  exponents from the store. `NORM_W_IMAGE` now pinned two-sided to
  `2*blocks+1` ops at elaboration (a LONG image was never refused; found
  by track E).
- **`gen_pcieep.py` refuses a missing seam/card pin at Python time** and
  the Tcl carries an `FK33_SEAMWIRE` existence guard; the old generator
  silently emitted a connect to a pin the wrapper did not have (MEASURED).
- **The card generics** now carry `B_SRC_REAL=true`, `B_CONST_HBM=true`
  and `NORM_W_IMAGE=hw/fk33/gen/norm_w_9b.hex` (99 BRAM tiles MEASURED by
  GAIN16's `cbland` on this exact image, not NWROM's 114). BD validated on
  the BC-250: `FK33_SEAMWIRE 37`, `FK33_UNCONNECTED count=0`,
  `FK33_BD_VALIDATE OK`.

**The verification (MEASURED, `tools/ref9b/gdn_oracle.py --b-const`, which
reads the packed image and runs the C model per layer; byte-identical to
the old oracle with the option off):**

| run (sim shape, real pooled weights) | R_Y match |
|---|---|
| 1 token, B_CONST_HBM | 3 of 3 |
| same capture, stand-in model | 0 of 3 (127-128 of 128 differ) |
| 3 tokens, B_SRC_REAL + B_STATE_AXI + B_CONST_HBM | **9 of 9** |
| control A: stand-in constants, real inputs | 0 of 9 |
| control B: image constants, stand-in inputs | 0 of 9 |

A gate-row track is turning this into `sim:gdnconst`, `sim:constimage`,
`sim:tb_llama_top_bconst` and `sim:seamgate_bconst`. The 9B-geometry store
bench with the fourth phase is running (`$SD/st9b`).

**Still stand-ins after this lands:** C's QK-norm gains (8 layers x 2 x
256, an image; not started). Nothing else in B or D.

**Next:** the constants build queues behind the maxpos build (one Vivado
here; maxpos is in routing). Recipe unchanged except the tree; budget
`MemoryHigh=20G`. Then: reload, load weights + `gdn_const.bin` + arena,
verify, `run_prompt` at token 0 against `reference_tokens.txt`, and the
step-8 probe (expect 3994).

### 2026-09-18 22:20: THE WRONG ARGMAX IS ROOT-CAUSED. THE CARD RUNS B ON STAND-IN INPUTS AND STAND-IN WEIGHTS, AND NO CARD BUILD HAS EVER ASKED FOR THE MODEL'S LEARNED CONSTANTS

`docs/debugging/2026-09-18_the-card-runs-subsystem-b-on-stand-in-inputs-and-weights.md`.

The step-8 mismatch (ssm_out on B's Y: card 2768, reference 3994) is not a
drain defect and not a B defect. **`hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` does not pass
`B_SRC_REAL`**, so on the card B's conv taps, alpha and beta are `m12`
stand-ins and B reads exactly one per-token input, z. Independently, the
conv WEIGHTS, `ssm_dt_bias`, `ssm_a` and the `ssm_norm` weight are stand-ins
in EVERY configuration (no path exists, `rtl/llama_top.vhd:4068`), the D-vec
norm gain is the synthetic ramp because `NORM_W_IMAGE` is not passed either,
and C's QK-norm gains are stand-ins. Same class as the 2026-09-11 "C is a
stub" finding, same file, found seven days later by the same grep. **And it was
already on this board**: the 2026-09-11 entry below names `NORM_W_IMAGE` a
correctness blocker and `B_SRC_REAL = false` a tracked gap; the bring-up
plan never carried it, so the first whole token was judged against the
reference with an outcome that was known in advance.

MEASURED, the drain is CLEARED: a new `--probe-dup-src REGION` in
`tools/gen_layer_program.py` appends a copy of the last A job reading REGION
and probes it, turning the sampler into a read port on any A-drained region.
`ssm_beta`/`ssm_alpha` reading Z: 5/25 = reference 5/25 (14%/28% margins);
reading QKV[0:4096] (q,k): 31/26 = reference 31/26 (34%/35%). B was not in
those programs. `attn_gate(Z)` is a 0.5% tie and is not a discriminator.

**What a correct token needs, and none of it is a bug fix:**

1. `B_SRC_REAL=true` in the card generics. Zero structural cost, verified in
   sim with the tier on 2026-09-05.
2. `NORM_W_IMAGE` at 9B (65 x 4096 gains, ~114 BRAM; 222 of 672 free on the
   running bitstream).
3. A path for B's conv weights (64 KiB per layer): through HBM as a fourth
   phase of `gdn_state_store`'s mover into a 16-tile BRAM, load-only. A
   1.5 MiB ROM (~341 tiles) does not fit. Plus `ssm_dt_bias`/`ssm_a`/
   `ssm_norm` (24 x 192 int16, an image). The oracle models `m12` weights and
   changes with it. THIS IS THE TRACK.
4. C's QK-norm gains, an image.

The maxpos build (`$SD/build4`, MAXPOS 131072 + grant address map, lands
~23:40) carries none of this; it is still worth loading for multi-token runs
past position 4, and its Y will still be wrong.

Uncommitted at this entry: `server/tests/run_prompt.c` (`--resume`,
`--seq-reset`), `server/pl_backend.c/.h` (`pl_resume_pos`),
`tools/gen_layer_program.py` (`--upto`, `--probe-smp`, `--probe-dup-src`,
partial arena image). Reference harnesses live in the session scratch
(`$SD/probe_ref.c`, `probe_ref2.c`, `probe_hyp.c`) and are described in the
debugging doc.

### 2026-09-18 21:10: FOUR WHOLE TOKENS RAN ON THE CARD. B COMPLETES. THE SEAM'S MAXPOS DEFAULTED TO 4. THE ARGMAX IS WRONG.

Bitstream `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_xexp_wdog_seam_75mhz_2026-09-18.bit`
(25,017,338 B, WNS +0.143, routed legally, built 21:03: x_exp port +
WDOG 4,000,000 + seam ack fix + progress registers). Oren reloaded it;
the weight image did NOT survive the reconfiguration (verify: 245 FAIL) and
was reloaded and re-verified (250/250), arena verified, layer 0's state
slot zeroed.

**`run_prompt --max-new 1`: positions 0, 1, 2, 3 each ran to `done=1`** --
504 issues (TBL_LEN - 1, the clean count), ~60.0M cycles = 0.80 s per token
at 75 MHz, `FAULTS = 0`, trips 0. MEASURED from the progress registers
polled every 2 ms:

| step | what | issued at cycle | took |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | first B_JOB (`blk.0`, GDN) | 320,642 | **617,226** (3x the old watchdog) |
| 12 | A_JOB `ffn_gate` 12,288 x 4,096 | 1,048,088 | 282,670 (89 B/cycle) |
| 503 -> 504 | last lm_head window -> END | 59,995,673 | done at 60,079,143 |

So subsystem B runs to completion on silicon with the tiered store, C's
attention layers ran (steps in between), the sampler saw all 248,320 logits
(`smp_n 248320`) and published an argmax.

**Then position 4 was refused EC_POS.** `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd:215 MAXPOS :
positive := 4` -- the simulation default -- and no build had ever set it.
`gen_pcieep.py` now sets `CONFIG.MAXPOS` from `gen_fk33_card.py`'s
`C_MAXPOS` (read from the file, not restated) with read-back. Build
`maxpos-build` launched 21:12 with that and the grant address map.

**The argmax is WRONG.** After the 4-token prefix `248045,846,198,623`
(`<|im_start|>user\nIn`) the card's argmax is **151353** (detokenises to an
invalid byte sequence). llama.cpp on the BF16 GGUF, `/completion` with the
same ids, greedy: **279** (" the"). `ref/run9b --acts bfp` (rung 3, the
hardware model) on the same ids is running for the third opinion. Every
structural check passed; the value is off. Exactly the case the README of
`goal_dcdc` warns about: a plausible-looking, silently wrong token.

Two candidate causes already on the table, neither measured: the x_exp
path was changed today and has no bench at `A_DESC = true`; and the card's
embedding is the packed INT4 row (`--mv4i`, recipe wide) where the
reference's headline runs use the BF16 row. The tool that settles it is
element-wise: `run9b --out F.r9bs` writes every region per step, and the
card exposes R_X through the XOUT window after a token.

### 2026-09-18 19:50: FULL GATE GREEN AT 141 (WAS 139 + 2 NEW ROWS); THE STATE STORE PASSES AT THE 9B GEOMETRY

`OVERALL PASS 141 FAIL 0 NOVERDICT 0 NOCHECK 5 SKIPPED 19`, `--jobs 2`,
beside the running Vivado. Includes `sim:tb_fk33_seam_wdog` and the
regress.sh judge fix (no row changed verdict under it).

`sim/tb_gdn_state_store` run by hand at the card's shape (VAL_HEADS 32,
DIM 128, AXI_DW 256, MAXB 16, MAXOUT 4, LAYER_STRIDE 1,101,824, 4 tokens x 2
layers): **827,408 checks, bad=0**. First time the store has been simulated
at 9B; needs `ulimit -s unlimited`. So if B hangs on the card it is not the
store's arithmetic; look at the grant/port path.

### 2026-09-18 18:40: A SECOND GO SHOWED THE SEAM MAKES ANY D ERROR PERMANENT; FIXED, REPRODUCED IN SIM, BUILD RESTARTED WITH EVERYTHING

Repeating the GO on a zeroed state slot gave the same error with **CYCLES =
1**: D never ran it. Cause in the RTL: the seam acked at the `err` instant,
a WDOG error raises `err` up to 200,000 cycles BEFORE `tok_done` (the
S_ABORT drain), D parked with `tok_done` high and ignored every later GO,
and the seam re-reported D's sticky error one cycle after each. Fixed:
ack follows `d_tok_done` as a level, the error latch waits for `d_busy`,
GO refused while `tok_done` is high; `pl_backend` waits for busy to drop
after an error. New row `sim:tb_fk33_seam_wdog` (WDOG_LIMIT 64, every
token a watchdog) with P7: FAILS on the old seam with the exact silicon
signature (`token 1 CYCLES = 1`), PASSES on the fix; `tb_fk33_seam`
landmark unchanged. Two read-only progress registers added (`STEPS_ISS`
0x7C, `ISSUE_CYC` 0x80) so a stuck token can be localised by polling.

Also found: `sim/regress.sh` judged the failing row NOVERDICT three times
(`printf | grep -q` under pipefail: SIGPIPE on a 13 MB log). Fixed with
`grep -c` in all three judge sites.

Build restarted 18:38 (`xexp-seam-build`): x_exp port + WDOG 4,000,000 +
seam ack fix + progress registers. ~21:40. The 11:28 bitstream on the card
cannot recover from any D error without a reload; B is not to be debugged
on it. Doc: addendum in
`docs/debugging/2026-09-18_first-token-on-silicon-stops-at-step-7.md`.

### 2026-09-18 18:30: THE FIRST GO ON THE COMPOSED CARD RAN SEVEN STEPS, AND THE WATCHDOG IS TOO SMALL FOR 9B BY ARITHMETIC

The 11:28 bitstream is on the card (Oren ran `fk33_reload.sh`; steps 0-3
clean: seam LLM2 v2, caps 0xD, 15 offsets agree). At Oren's direction the
non-sudo steps ran from this session: step 4 (`run_prompt --open-only
--allow-hardware HOST`, 505 descriptors streamed and read back, TBL_LEN 505,
ARENA 0x1_FFADD000, BST 0x1_0C006000 read back), step 7 (flat `noembd`
image, 4.18 GiB in 6.35 s, digest-verified; arena 159,232 B verified), step
8 (`--max-new 1`).

**Result: the GO was ACCEPTED, D ran a VEC_NORM and SIX A JOBS through the
card's descriptor plane -- `ga_desc`, the arm no bench covers -- in ~320,000
cycles with FAULTS 0, then the first B job hit `WDOG_LIMIT = 200,000` and D
reported ERR_WDOG** (`ERR_INFO 0x00070074`: code 4, step 7, 7 done; CYCLES
520,706). The seam wraps it as code 6 and `pl_backend` printed "the
descriptor program was refused", which is wrong for this case; both
messages now decode ERR_INFO.

**200,000 cannot fit a 9B job, DERIVED two ways** (doc:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-18_first-token-on-silicon-stops-at-step-7.md`): B's
recurrent pass alone is 131,072 cycles plus 68,864 state beats each way;
and at the MEASURED A rate (~80 B/cycle on the flat image) the 12,288-row
FFN jobs need ~320,000 each, so step 11 would fire it even with B fixed.
`gen_fk33_card.py` now passes `WDOG_LIMIT=4000000` (53 ms at 75 MHz).
Whether B completes at all is NOT established; the rebuild answers it.

The running x_exp build (17:25) does not carry the watchdog. Decision
pending: restart with both, or let it finish and queue a second.

### 2026-09-18 17:25: THE x_exp FIX IS IN THE TREE, NOT YET IN A BITSTREAM

Oren chose the live port. Four generators edited, five generated files
regenerated, and every board-free check that can see the change is green:

* `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` (`tools/gen_cardtop.py`): `ga_desc` now claims the
  exponent read port at issue (`a_exp_region <= job_src`, the sibling arms'
  line, **which this arm had never had**), latches `r_xexp` from
  `exp_rd_data` in `S_GO` on the edge `ad_start` first rises, and exports it
  as `a_x_exp`. `gnd_a` ties it off in the other arm.
* `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` (`gen_fk33_engine.py`): generic
  `USE_XEXP_PORT := false` forwarded to the unit; port `d_x_exp` on
  `x_exp_in`. Default FALSE so the host-driven engine-only flow is untouched.
* `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` (`gen_pcieep.py`, `FK33_CARD=1` only):
  `CONFIG.USE_XEXP_PORT {true}` on `eng` with a readback, and the net
  `card/a_x_exp -> eng/d_x_exp`. Same environment test for both halves,
  asserted equal.
* `fk33_card.vhd`, `compose4_top.vhd`: regenerated. `sim:c4stale` caught the
  second one RED before it was regenerated, which is the gate doing its job.

MEASURED: `tb_fk33_cardtop_adesc` checks 13 -> 14 (`a_x_exp` driven at
`A_DESC = true`); `tb_fk33_cardtop_ident` PASS 108 unchanged; `cardtop`,
`runguard`, `kvmap`, `c4stale` green; `--bd-only` under `FK33_CARD=1`:
`FK33_XEXP_PORT true`, `FK33_UNCONNECTED count=0`, `FK33_BD_VALIDATE OK`,
0 errors. Wire mutant (net row removed from the generator): `count=1
/eng/d_x_exp`, FAIL. **And the mutant showed Vivado prints NO 41-759 for a
defaulted port** -- the check is the only guard on that wire (CLAUDE.md,
TRAPS).

NOT measured: the value. No bench runs a job through `ga_desc` against a
descriptor-plane engine. The oracle is the card (`run_prompt` first
divergence vs `reference_tokens.txt`). Doc: fourth addendum of
`docs/debugging/2026-09-17_x-exp-is-baked-into-every-a-descriptor.md`.

**Next: a full `FK33_CARD=1` build with the fix, same recipe as 11:28**
(`FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75
FK33_IMPL_STRATEGY=Congestion_SpreadLogic_high`, `MemoryHigh=20G`). One
32-bit register and one 32-bit net against a design that routed at +0.061;
not launched until Oren says so. Meanwhile the 11:28 bitstream is on the
bench for steps 0-5, which the fix does not touch.

### 2026-09-18 11:28: A BITSTREAM WITH THE SAMPLER, BOTH HBM BASES WIRED, AND THE K CACHE OUT OF THE GDN ARENA

**`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_smp_bases_75mhz_2026-09-18.bit`**, 24,880,718 B,
sha256 `a8db5c2b...`. `FK33_BUILD_DONE`, 0 errors, **routed legally** (node
overlaps converged to 0, no `[Route 35-2]`), **`FK33_TIMING WNS=+0.061 ns
WHS=+0.009 ns`** from the build's own sentinel, 0 of 1,412,614 endpoints
failing. Reports and the full log in
`hw/fk33/results/card_smp_bases_2026-09-18/`.

| routed | 2026-09-17 19:04 (no sampler) | **this** |
|---|---|---|
| CLB LUTs | 336,326 (76.49%) | **342,479 (77.89%)** |
| CLB Registers | 304,036 | 306,570 |
| BRAM / URAM / DSP | 449.5 / 32 / 2121 | 449.5 / 32 / 2121 |
| WNS | +0.009 | **+0.061** |
| strategy | Performance_RefinePlacement | **Congestion_SpreadLogic_high** |

Same-stage, same-tree comparison (both routed, both `report_utilization` after
`write_bitstream`, mtime checked). The sampler and the seam registers cost
**+6,153 LUT / +2,534 FF**; BRAM, URAM and DSP are identical.

**What it carries that 19:04 did not:** `SMP_EN=true` with `CAPS_FLAGS=0xD`
(`e62fded`); `a_arena_base` and `bst_state_base` driven from seam registers
`0x6C..0x78`, with a GO refused while either is zero (`2bcd236`); C's K/V
cache moved 1,179,648 B up, out of the correctly sized GDN arena (`2bcd236`);
and the `FK33_UNCONNECTED` build check, which printed `count=0` inside this
run. **This is the first `FK33_CARD=1` build with no `[BD 41-759]` in its
log.**

**What it does NOT carry, stated:** the baked `x_exp`
(`docs/debugging/2026-09-17_x-exp-is-baked-into-every-a-descriptor.md`),
still an open design question; and no whole-token bench covers the
`A_DESC = true` arm this bitstream implements.

**The congestion question is answered by this run and not by a controlled
experiment.** Two variables changed against the failed build: the strategy,
and the bases/K-V. It routed. The clean control (19:04 sources under this
strategy) was not run, so "the strategy fixed it" is the likely reading and
not a measured one.

**Bring-up:** `docs/2026-09-18_seam-bringup-on-the-card.md`, steps 1 onward,
now including the base registers in step 4 and the argmax read in step 8.
Card work is Oren's.

### 2026-09-17 22:00: THE HOST CAN NOW SPEAK THE SEAM THE BITSTREAM CARRIES, AND TWO BLOCKERS SURFACED ON THE WAY

**The finding that reordered the evening.** Looking for what would drive the
seam on card day found that nothing could:

| | before tonight |
|---|---|
| `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd` | **v2** since TRACK DSEAM: windows, `TBL_LEN`, `X_EXP`, no HBM fetch |
| `server/fk33_sim.c` | v1 only |
| `server/pl_backend.c` | v1 only -- writes a block at `X_BASE` and GOes |
| `hw/fk33/host/*.py` | the **engine at 0x12000**, never the seam |

The bitstream in place-and-route implemented a protocol no program in the repo
spoke. `8bdea36` + `47055c4` give the simulator a v2 mode (version-switched, so
v1's 84 checks keep their meaning); `ace2ce6` makes `pl_backend` speak it.
**124 checks, 0 failed**, up from 84 this morning. `server_e2e.py` still PASS.

MEASURED, driving the sim with the REAL 505-descriptor program:

```
program    token.dtbl: 8080 halves (505 descriptors of 8 64-bit words)
card       seam v2 @BAR+0xE000 ... chunk=1
decode     1197 ids generated, pos 1219
bytes      h2c 19972096, go 1219
```

1,219 GOs for 1,219 positions, and 19,972,096 = 1219 * 4096 * 4 exactly.

**THERE IS NO CHUNKED PREFILL ON THIS CARD.** `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd:746` refuses
any `N_STEP` but 1, with a comment on the line. A 23-token prompt is 23 GOs,
and each is **4,096 MMIO writes** of the activation row where v1 did one DMA.
`pl_open` now forces `max_chunk` to 1 and says so, rather than letting a host
discover it one `EC_NSTEP` at a time.

**I got the v2 model wrong first, from the header's prose, and the RTL said
otherwise** (`47055c4`). Two contradictions, each of which would have produced
a wrong driver rather than a failing test: `N_STEP` above, and `TBL_LEN = 0`
being `EC_NSTEP` and not `EC_DESC`. The model was also STRICTER than the card
in two places, which is worse than useless -- those are now `model_strict`,
off by default.

**BLOCKER FOUND AND FIXED: the packed manifest's GDN arena was 1,179,648 B
short**, exactly `24 layers x 49,152 B` of conv tap history
(`docs/debugging/2026-09-17_gdn-arena-omitted-the-conv-tap-history.md`). Stale
artefact, not a code defect. The lane-striped manifest had it too and was
migrated; three older packs are over-reserved, which is safe. The cross-check
was worth more than the fix: the program emits **505** descriptors and
`fk33_seam.vhd:123-125` predicts that number outright, and it fits the card's
windows exactly (505 <= `REL_ENT` 576, 505*8 = 4040 <= `DESC_WORDS` 4608).

**BLOCKER FOUND, NOT FIXED, AND IT NEEDS A DECISION:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-17_x-exp-is-baked-into-every-a-descriptor.md`.**
`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd:1309` sets `USE_XEXP_PORT => false`, so the card's
A takes `x_exp` from the DESCRIPTOR -- which the RTL's own comment calls "stale
by construction" in the integrated system -- and
`gen_layer_program.py:666` bakes ONE `--x-exp` into all 311 of them.
`seq_opdec.vhd:531` propagates the unit's `y_exp`, so the error carries.
**DERIVED from reading, NOT measured.**

**And the larger gap the same file found:** the card's A binding is
`A_DESC = true` (`fk33_card.vhd:217`), and **no whole-token bench covers it**.
`llama_top` uses `matvec_int4`, a unit with no descriptor plane;
`fk33_llama_top.vhd:738-749` names the two arms and says "THE TWO ARE NOT
EQUIVALENT AND MUST NOT BE READ AS A TUNING CHOICE". So the card's A path has
unit coverage and **no token-level coverage**, which is why 300 passing checks
in `sim_tb_llama_top_seq` have never seen the `x_exp` question.

**Also landed:** `fk33ctl.py seam` (`67c7071`), the first host-side read of the
seam at all -- `fk33_regs.h` had no seam block. One read-only pass, writes
nothing, distinguishes a dead bus from a real-but-wrong answer from a tie-off,
and cross-checks its own register map against `server/fk33_seam.h` at run time.

Build status at 21:59: routing, phase 3.2, 0 errors, 0 placement overlaps,
post-placement WNS +0.375 (**which is not a result** -- nothing before
`route_design` orders two runs correctly on this part).

### 2026-09-17 21:10: THERM-255's HOST HALF IS LANDED, AND THE GOAL HAS A HARNESS

Two things landed while the `FK33_CARD=1` + sampler build runs (started 20:45,
in synthesis at 21:05; unit `buildsmp`, capped `MemoryHigh=20G`, one Vivado on
this box and none on the BC-250).

**`5e8495d` -- THERM-255, all six consumers.** `729df43` enumerated them and
said outright that the fix was designed but NOT landed, because the obvious one
turns a dead veto into a phantom retry on every job. That is resolved: `run_job`
clears the trip counter and PROVES the clear, then publishes
`p["therm"] = dict(trip0, trip1, moved, cleared, guard, saturated)`, and
`run_token`'s wrapper reads that instead of sampling the register either side of
a call that clears it. **The phantom trip is not an argument, it is measured**:
the old wrapper logs `1 call / 1 trip` on a job that merely cleared the counter,
the new one logs `1 call / 0 trip`. The RTL is untouched -- saturation is
correct -- and the CORRECTION is appended in place to the original write-up.
Three new `fk33_run_job.py selfcheck` rows, three new `fk33_run_token.py
selfcheck` rows over a wrapper that **had no coverage at all**, and the 255
fixture section 2a asked for. Every one with its attribution control.

**`2d3cbcf` -- `server/tests/run_prompt.c`.** The committed goal
(`hw/fk33/results/goal_dcdc_2026-09-17/`) now has a program that drives it:
`pl_prefill` then `pl_decode`, FIRST DIVERGENCE against the 1,197 reference
ids. Simulated transport only, never a `/dev` path. MEASURED: the full 1,197
generated, pos 1219, `h2c 10064064 = 1219 * 8256` exactly, no negative return in
1,197 iterations. **The divergence at position 0 is the expected result and
proves nothing about any number** -- the sim's logits are synthetic. It proves
the loop, and the reference becomes an oracle the day it points at silicon.
`--check-argmax` adds the one check with teeth today: the host rescans the
returned row against the card's own argmax register. That is NOT
`pl_backend.c:742`, which compares the row HEADER against the register, two
copies of one computed index; this recomputes it from the data and so catches
both copies being wrong together, which is the `smp_base` shape fixed in
`e62fded`. New sim knob `fault_argmax_bias` exists because the obvious mutant
(`fault_stale_argmax`) is intercepted by the existing check and would have
credited the new one with a kill it did not make.

**Open on both: neither has run against the card.**


### 2026-09-17 19:06: THE WHOLE DESIGN FITS. A, B, C AND D, ROUTED, 75 MHz.

`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_withA_75mhz_2026-09-17.bit`, 24,938,098 bytes,
`FK33_BUILD_DONE`, 0 errors. **Subsystem A is IN.**

| | this morning | now |
|---|---|---|
| post-synthesis LUT | 479,909 (**109.15%**) | **347,629 (79.06%)** |
| routed LUT | never routed | **336,326 (76.49%)** = 284,283 logic + 52,043 memory |
| registers | 500,677 | 304,036 (34.57%) |
| route | gave up, global congestion **level 7** | 0 failed / 0 unrouted / 0 overlaps |
| WNS / WHS | never reached | **+0.009 / +0.010**, TNS/THS 0.000 |

**THE ENTIRE GAP WAS ONE LINE.** `gen_vstub[2].gv.vproc.buf` was
`variable buf : buf_t(0 to REGMAX-1)` in a clocked process -- 12,288 x 16 =
196,608 bits in FLIP-FLOPS, 39% of the design's registers -- and the thing
stopping it inferring as memory was a **statically dead** 12,288-wide
combinational read (the NORM_ANCHOR probe). Its identical twin `buf2` had been
distributed RAM all along. `251cbca`, writeup in
`docs/debugging/2026-09-17_one-flop-array-was-the-whole-lut-gap.md`.

**TWO OBVIOUS-LOOKING FIXES CHANGED NOTHING FIRST** -- both measured at
`lut=292383 ff=357608`, identical to the digit: hoisting to a single read site
(the recorded `region_mem` 3-refused/2-accepted threshold does NOT carry over)
and `ram_style` on its own (**no `8-6849` ever named the array** -- Vivado
never treated it as a RAM candidate, which is silence, not a refusal).

**WHAT THIS IS NOT.** A routed bitstream is not a working accelerator. It fits,
closes timing, and is loadable. **It has NOT been on the card** -- programming
needs a human. Whether A computes correctly in hardware is untested, and the
two known gaps are unchanged: `ga_desc` has NO value coverage, and the `x_exp`
divergence between the two A arms is unexplained.

**DO NOT** difference this against the 2026-09-16 engine-less build (316,167
LUT) to price subsystem A at ~20,000 LUT. That build predates this fix, so the
arms differ in RTL as well as in A's presence.

**STILL AVAILABLE if more LUTs are ever needed:** `buf` and `buf2` are 1,152
`RAM64M8` between them and BRAM is at 66.89%, URAM at 10%. And the same
question has not been asked of `u_arr` (50,523 LUT) or `u_kv` (23,101 LUT,
zero LUTRAM).

---

### 2026-09-17 03:50: THERE IS A BITSTREAM. IT CONTAINS B, C AND D, AND NO SUBSYSTEM A.

`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_card_noeng_75mhz_2026-09-17.bit`, 24,695,270 bytes,
`FK33_BUILD_DONE`, 0 errors. Built with
`FK33_CARD=1 FK33_ENG=0 FK33_CB_STYLE=distributed FK33_ENG_CORE_MHZ=75`.

**READ THIS BEFORE USING IT: it is not a working accelerator.** With no engine,
Vivado ties `a_y_we`, `a_y_addr`, `a_y_data`, `a_y_mask`, `a_y_exp`,
`a_job_done` and `a_job_err` to 0, so an A job issued by subsystem D never
reports done and the host's poll hangs. It proves the FLOW -- synthesis, place,
route, timing, bitstream over B, C, D, the host seam and the PCIe/HBM shell --
and NOTHING about subsystem A. Label it that way wherever it is used.

**IT HAS NOT BEEN ON THE CARD.** Programming is a hardware action and needs a
human; nothing in this session went near `/dev/xdma*`, `xsdb` or `flash.sh`.

| stage | result |
|---|---|
| synthesis | 330,408 LUT (**75.15%**), 425,925 FF (48.44%), 257 BRAM, 32 URAM, 536 DSP; peak 14.29 GB under a 20G cap, so a real peak |
| place | WNS +0.463 pre-route (**not a result** -- it gave back 0.45 ns, inside the recorded 0.4-0.6 band) |
| route | **WNS +0.013, WHS +0.010**, TNS/THS 0.000; 0 failed / 0 unrouted / 0 partially routed / 0 node overlaps; congestion **level 5** against the engine-on build's level 7; 3 h 30 m |

Reports in `hw/fk33/results/noeng_2026-09-17/` (`ff8af51`). Full account, with
the dead ends, in `docs/debugging/2026-09-16_card-build-is-lut-bound-at-109-percent.md`.

**WHAT THIS DOES NOT RESOLVE.** The card WITH subsystem A is still 109.15% LUT
and still does not route. Nothing here reclaimed a single LUT of that; the
engine was removed, not shrunk. The open item is unchanged and is
architectural: 22,000-31,000 LUT.

**THREE DEFECTS FOUND ON THE WAY, TWO OF THEM MINE (`a138ad0`, `5d880ff`):**

- `_ENG_ADDR_PART` opened with `+=` in the card-off branch, so **the
  engine-only build could not generate at all** while the card build was fine.
  It survived because the byte-identity check was run only with `FK33_CARD=1`:
  a control applied to the arm that was never broken.
- **`--selftest` graded whatever configuration was last written to disk.** Row
  expectations come from the environment, the mutated text from the file, and
  nothing compared them: the same command printed PASS, then FAIL, then PASS,
  with no code change. A mismatch is now VOID with the command to fix it.
- Two address-map rows were engine-dependent and said so only by failing (A5
  now an explicit SKIP, A6's expectation follows `ENG_ON`).

**NEXT, and it is Oren's call:**
1. Program the card with this bitstream and exercise B/C/D from the host (needs
   a human at the hardware).
2. Or go after the 22,000-31,000 LUT so subsystem A can come back.

### 2026-09-16: THE ELABORATION WALL IS DOWN. THE CARD SYNTHESISES. A FULL BITSTREAM BUILD IS RUNNING.

**The wall was never the memory SIZE. It was the WRITE PORT COUNT.**

`ga_desc.ap` and `ga_real.ap` stored y as `variable yb : buf_t(0 to
A_MAXROWS-1)` written inside `for rr in 0 to A_ROWS_IF-1 loop` at the DYNAMIC
index `to_integer(unsigned(y_addr)) + rr`. That is `A_ROWS_IF` INDEPENDENT
WRITE PORTS. At 4 (default) Vivado gives up fast with `[Synth 8-3391]`; at 48
(the card) elaboration never returns and emits nothing at all.

**Killed by its own control:** `A_MAXROWS` forced 12,288 -> 512, a 24x
reduction, HANGS EXACTLY AS HARD. Every earlier `A_MAXROWS` control had been
run at DEFAULT generics where nothing is broken, so it could not have failed.
**A control applied to the healthy arm is decoration.** And `8-3391`'s text
blames the bit count and suggests `dissolveMemorySizeLimit` -- a remedy that
would have changed nothing. Full bisect in
`docs/debugging/2026-09-14_the-wall-is-a-3d-ram-vivado-warned-about.md`.

**LANDED TODAY**

| commit | what |
|---|---|
| `dcbea17` | `ga_tie` fix: the card's six weight-master outputs had NO DRIVER in the only shipping configuration. New row `sim:tb_fk33_cardtop_adesc`, the first thing ever to elaborate the `A_DESC` arm. Teeth: 6 bad pre-fix, 0 post-fix, 7 `a_*` controls pass in BOTH. |
| `2f4ab91` | `gb_real.bp.yb` -> block RAM. Teeth: read-index mutant fails `tb_llama_top_real`. |
| `6a2d282` | `ga_desc.ap.yb` -> one beat per word. **Card elaborates: 3:54, 0 errors**, from a >25 min silent hang. |
| `f4e69bf` | `ga_real.ap.yb`, same defect at 4 ports. Teeth: lane-reversal mutant fails `tb_llama_top_real` at `R_X(0) = -16111`. |
| `4b1d58f` | DSP census over-counted **9x**. See below. |
| `a913ca8` `03ca377` `85c7898` `63fe87f` | corrections and root cause, appended in place. |

All three 196,608-bit process variables are gone (`zb` was `587d9b5`).

**MILESTONES MEASURED TODAY**

- **`fk33_card` full synthesis: 745 s, 0 errors, 61 MB DCP.** B, C and D are a
  netlist for the first time.
- **`--bd-only` with `FK33_CARD=1`: `FK33_BD_VALIDATE OK`,
  `FK33_BD_ONLY_DONE`**, 0 errors, `FK33_ENG portcheck bad=0`, zero
  address-overlap warnings, all seven AXI interfaces inferred. That is the
  class no bench can reach.
- **A full `FK33_CARD=1` bitstream build is RUNNING** (launched 14:18, cap
  `MemoryHigh=18G`, 24 GB free, `llama-server` left up).

**CORRECTED CARD AREA (B+C+D; A is a separate cell), xcvu33p:**

| resource | used | available | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLB LUT | 292,383 | 439,680 | 66.5% |
| DSP48E2 | **538** | 2,880 | 18.7% |
| Block RAM | 197 | 672 | 29.3% |
| URAM | 32 | 320 | 10.0% |

**THE DSP FIGURE WAS FIRST REPORTED AS 4,842, i.e. 168% AND "DOES NOT FIT".**
`REF_NAME =~ DSP*` matches each `DSP48E2` PLUS its eight internal primitives:
538 * 9 = 4842. A plausible-looking over-count on the one resource most likely
to be exhausted, and it would have been quoted as a blocker against B and C.
Cross-checked against the log's own `Report Cell Usage` (the LUT sum matches
to the digit). Same class as the recorded `PRIMITIVE_GROUP == DSP` trap, which
matched NOTHING -- **a census filter can be wrong in both directions.**

**WHAT IS STILL NOT VERIFIED, and a bitstream will not change it**

- **`ga_desc` has NO value coverage.** The identity bench connects none of the
  `a_*` ports, so `6a2d282` is verified for elaboration and structure only.
  `ga_real`'s twin fix IS teeth-tested, which is the difference.
- **The `x_exp` divergence is OPEN** and would break the arm-identity claim if
  real: `ga_real` reads it live from the lock, the card engine takes it from
  the descriptor (`fk33_engine.vhd:1309` `USE_XEXP_PORT => false`), there is no
  `a_x_exp` port, and `gen_layer_program.py` bakes ONE static value per program
  while `fk33_seam.h` calls `X_EXP` a per-token host register.
- **`BASELINE_PASS` deliberately NOT raised** for `sim:tb_fk33_cardtop_adesc`:
  the floor is a clean-checkout number and this tree carries 23 working-tree-only
  rows.


### 2026-09-15: THE CARD'S WEIGHT MASTERS HAD NO DRIVER, AND TWO THINGS THE SEAM BENCH MUST SETTLE FIRST

**LANDED, teeth-tested.** `fk33_llama_top`'s six weight-master OUTPUT ports
(`m_arvalid`, `m_araddr`, `m_arlen`, `m_arsize`, `m_arburst`, `m_rready`) had
**no driver at all** in the card configuration (`A_BEHAV` false, `A_DESC`
true). `ga_real` drives them, `ga_tie` ties them off, and their guards are
`if not A_BEHAV and not A_DESC` and `if A_BEHAV` -- so the card matched
NEITHER. Fixed in `tools/gen_cardtop.py` as `ga_tie : if A_BEHAV or A_DESC`.
Full write-up:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-15_card-top-weight-masters-undriven.md`.

New gate row `sim:tb_fk33_cardtop_adesc`, which is **the first thing in this
project ever to elaborate the `A_DESC` arm**. MEASURED, both directions:
against the pre-fix guard `checks=13 bad=6` (exactly the six ports), against
the fix `checks=13 bad=0`. The seven `a_*` checks are a POSITIVE CONTROL and
pass in BOTH runs, which is what makes the six failures attributable to the
tie-off rather than to a generate that never elaborated.

**It does NOT close the coverage gap of `9b4477a`.** It checks that ports have
DRIVERS, not that the binding computes anything. That remains open.

#### AND THE SEAM BENCH IS BIGGER THAN "FLIP THE GENERIC" -- TWO BLOCKERS FOUND BY READING

**(a) The bench has no engine on the far side of the `a_*` ports.**
`sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd` never connects one: `grep -cE
"\ba_(awaddr|wdata|bvalid|y_we|y_data|job_done|x_we)\b"` returns **0** and its
port map ends at `bst_bresp`. With `A_DESC => true`, `a_bvalid` is stuck low so
`a_desc_adapter` never completes a descriptor write and `ad_done` never
asserts; `a_y_we` is stuck low so no y beat arrives. The arm HANGS; it does not
run. **A behavioural stub is ruled out by the bench's own header** -- *"the
true arm drives the REAL `matvec_int4_desc_axi` and not a behavioural model of
it"*, on the m7-mutant round-trip argument. So the bench must instantiate the
real engine and build a descriptor arena reproducing `ga_real`'s S_EXP
arithmetic exactly (`n_rows`, `n_cols`, `out_shift`, `w_exp`, `out_mode`,
`w_base[p] = A_MEM_BASE + j_step*A_JOB_STRIDE + p*A_SUB_BYTES`, `s_base`,
`w_beats = tiles*nb`, `s_beats = (tiles*nb*A_ROWS_IF*2+15)/16`).

**(b) OPEN, AND IT MAY BREAK THE IDENTITY CLAIM OUTRIGHT: the two arms do not
agree on where `x_exp` comes from.** `ga_real` reads it LIVE from the lock
(`r_xexp <= resize(exp_rd_data, 32)`, S_EXP), which its own comment calls *"the
producing job's captured exponent ... part of the locked object"*. The card's
engine takes it from the DESCRIPTOR: `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd:1309` sets
`USE_XEXP_PORT => false` and `:1353` ties `x_exp_in => x_exp_zero`. And
`fk33_llama_top` has **no `a_x_exp` port**, so `ga_desc` has no way to send a
live value even if the engine would take one. Meanwhile
`tools/gen_layer_program.py` takes `x_exp` as **one program-level argument**
(`a.x_exp`, required at `:1175`), i.e. a single static value stamped into every
descriptor.

`matvec_int4_desc_axi`'s own header already states the hazard: *"the activation
vector's block exponent is a per-token value produced by the previous stage, so
the descriptor's copy is stale by construction"*, and `USE_XEXP_PORT` exists
precisely to fix it. **The card does not use it.**

**AND THE LIVE VALUE IS EXPLICITLY PER-TOKEN**, which makes the static copy
more suspicious rather than less. `server/fk33_seam.h:265-276` calls `TBL_LEN`
and `X_EXP` *"the two things subsystem D actually needs from a host every
token"*, and maps `X_EXP` to the top's `host_x_exp` port
(`rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd:765`, consumed at `:1714`). So the live path is
host -> `host_x_exp` -> the exponent lock -> `ga_real`'s `exp_rd_data`, updated
every token; the descriptor path is a value frozen at program-generation time.

**NOT YET DETERMINED, and do not write this up as a defect until it is:**
whether the shipping flow keeps the descriptor's `x_exp` current by other means
(the host rewriting descriptors per token), or whether `x_exp` is intended to be
fixed for a program. If neither holds, the two arms cannot compute identically
and the bench's landmark rule -- *"THE LANDMARKS ARE NOT RE-DERIVED FOR THE
true ARM AND MUST NOT BE"* -- is unsatisfiable as written. **Settle this BEFORE
building the arena**, because the arena's `x_exp` field is the thing in
question and building it first would bake the assumption in.

#### STILL OPEN, unchanged
The `8-3391` y stores: `ga_desc.ap.yb` (the one the CARD builds),
`ga_real.ap.yb` (`rtl/llama_top.vhd:3543`) and `gb_real.bp.yb` (`:4477`), all
12,288-element process variables. `gb_real.bp.zb` was fixed in `587d9b5`.


### 2026-09-12: THE A AUDIT -- A MEASURED 42,633-LUT LEVER SITTING UNUSED, AND A CHECK THE CARD QUALIFIES FOR

Completing the per-subsystem generic audit (B, C and D done; A was the gap).
`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` has exactly two generics and
`hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` passes **neither**, so both defaults apply.
**Neither is a defect -- both are documented -- but one is a large unused
lever.**

**1. `CB_STYLE = "regs"`, and `"distributed"` is worth -42,633 CLB LUT.**
Already MEASURED by TRACK LEVERC48 (`a4828ab`) at `ROWS_IF = 48`:
**-42,633 CLB LUT, MUXF7 24,583 -> 0, MUXF8 12,288 -> 0**, costing
**+13,195 CLB FF and +12,288 LUTRAM**. That is **9.7% of the part's 439,680
LUT**, available today.

**BUT THE FIGURE IS 264 COMMITS OLD AND A'S PATH HAS MOVED.** `a4828ab` is
dated **2026-08-30**; `git rev-list --count a4828ab..HEAD` = **264**, and
`git diff --name-only` over A's path shows **`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd`,
`rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd` and `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd` have all
changed since**. `rtl/matvec_core.vhd`, which holds the `CB_STYLE`
implementation itself, has NOT. **Re-measure before acting on -42,633.** This
file already records a case where a week-old area table was wrong by 9.7x on
one subsystem and a whole conclusion was built on it; 264 commits is a good
deal more than a week.

The default is DELIBERATE and the reason is stated in the file: `"regs"` is
*"the shipping value and keeps this entity byte-identical in behaviour to the
bitstream on card 1"*. **So this is a DECISION, not an oversight** -- but it
is a decision made when the fit looked hopeless, and tonight's corrected B and
C figures change what it is being traded against. Worth re-deciding, not worth
flipping silently.

Note the file also records WHY the lever was previously unreachable: it was
forwarded through `matvec_int4_desc_axi`/`matvec_int4`/`matvec_int4_axi` but
`fk33_engine` -- the entity the card and `compose4_top` actually bind -- had
no generics at all, so it was reachable *"from a unit synthesis of
matvec_core and from NO top the card or the composition actually builds"*.
**And `-generic` on the `synth_design` line does not help: it reaches the
TOP's generics only, never a deep instance.**

**2. `CHECK_JOB_INDEX = false`, and the card QUALIFIES for true.** The file's
own rule: *"A build that drives `job_index` from `rtl/a_job_counter.vhd` sets
this true and gains the check."* VERIFIED: `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`
instantiates `u_jc : entity work.a_job_counter` and wires
`job_index => a_job_index` (:3666). The card therefore drives it from the
counter and is **not opting in**, losing the v2 descriptor index check that
refuses *"a well-formed descriptor for the WRONG step"*.

This is the file's stated safe direction -- *"forgetting to opt in loses a
check, forgetting to opt out breaks a working card"* -- so it is a missed
check rather than a hazard. `gen_compose4_top.py --wire` already opts in; the
card does not.

### 2026-09-12 (earlier): B'S 5,472-BRAM BLOCKER IS THE ARM THE CARD DOES NOT BUILD. ON THE CARD'S ARM IT IS 50.

**MEASURED, one variable, same tree, same box, both arms 0 errors**
(`GDNADAPT_MAXROWS=2048` on BOTH, only `B_STATE_AXI` varied):

| `B_STATE_AXI` | LUT | FF | BRAM | URAM | DSP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `false` -- what EVERY prior B figure used | 148,995 | 77,973 | **5,472** | 0 | 191 |
| `true` -- **what `fk33_card.vhd` passes** | 85,255 | 69,783 | **50** | **32** | 194 |

**The project's headline B blocker -- "5,472 RAMB36 against 672 on the part"
-- is an ARTIFACT OF THE ARM THE CARD DOES NOT BUILD.** On the card's arm B's
mover uses **50 of 672 BRAM tiles and 32 of 320 URAM288**. It fits, with room.
LUT falls 43% as well.

**Two independent corroborations, which is why this is not another of tonight's
mis-measurements:**
1. The CONTROL reproduces 5,472 **exactly**, so the setup is sound and the
   figure's true configuration is now known: `B_STATE_AXI=false`,
   `MAXROWS_OVR=2048` -- NOT the 9B shape, which fails by documented design.
2. The recorded standalone `gdn_state_store` figure is **32 URAM288**, and 32
   URAM288 is precisely what appears when the tiered arm is selected --
   because `gen_st_tier` is what instantiates it. Two separate measurements
   agreeing on a number that only exists in one of the two arms.

**SCOPE LIMIT, stated rather than glossed:** `maxrows=2048`, so the LUT and FF
magnitudes are NOT 9B figures. The BRAM result should carry to 9B because the
flat state array is sized by LAYERS (`NLY*STLY`) and not by `MAXROWS` -- but
that is REASONING, not measurement, and the 9B shape cannot be synthesised in
this harness at all (`zb`/`yb` are process variables of 12,288 x 16 bits).

**WHAT THIS CHANGES.** "B does not fit" has been a standing project premise.
It rests on a measurement of a configuration the card does not build. Taken
with the corrected C figure (112,519 LUT at the card's shape, area in the MAC
array), **both of the two subsystems believed to be area blockers were
measured in configurations the card does not use.**

### 2026-09-12 (earlier): B'S HARNESS FAILS AT THE 9B SHAPE BY DOCUMENTED DESIGN, AND I CALLED IT A DEFECT

**WITHDRAWN IN FULL, WITHIN THE HOUR, AND THE HEADING ABOVE IS THE CLAIM BEING
WITHDRAWN.** I recorded that `sim/ooc_gdnadapt.tcl` "does not run at HEAD" and
that the headline B blocker was therefore unreproducible. **Both are wrong.**

`rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd:69-79` documents this failure in its own header:

> `MAXROWS_OVR` ... exists because the block declares `zb` and `yb` as process
> VARIABLES of `buf_t(0 to A_MAXROWS-1)`, and at the 9B shape that is
> 12,288 x 16 bits EACH. **Synthesis of the extracted block at the default
> shape fails:** `ERROR: [Synth 8-3391] ... 'gb_real.bp.zb_reg' ...` and Vivado
> then terminates abnormally (signal 11). **This generic is the control that
> separates "the block is unsynthesisable" from "the block is unsynthesisable
> AT THIS SIZE", which are different findings.**

So the harness behaves exactly as documented, `MAXROWS_OVR` is the provided
workaround, and 196,608 bits is precisely `12,288 x 16`. I ran it at the
default `MAXROWS_OVR=0` and reported the documented outcome as a defect.

**What this cost, and the lesson:** a control run of the pre-edit script (the
right instinct) correctly told me my edit was innocent -- and I then converted
"not my edit" into "already broken" without reading the twenty lines of header
that name the error verbatim. **Ruling out one cause promotes nothing; this
file already says so about the BRAM attribution, and I did it again.** The
cheap step I skipped was reading the entity, which this file also already
prescribes.

**FOUR wrong claims of mine in this one thread, each retracted by evidence:**
(1) `C_MAXPOS=131072` breaks it -- refuted at `maxpos=4`; (2) harness and card
"disagree" about `zb_reg` -- built on (1); (3) the harness is broken at HEAD --
refuted by its own header; (4) commit `121dc7d`'s message attributing the
5,472 RAMB36 figure to this harness's flat arm -- still unsupported, since the
figure's own `MAXROWS` is unknown. I also varied TWO generics at once in the
first attempt.

**WHAT IS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED, all of it structural and read from the RTL:**
`B_STATE_AXI` selects `gen_st_flat : if not B_STATE_AXI` (the flat all-layers
state array) against `gen_st_tier : if B_STATE_AXI` (state over AXI to HBM);
`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` passes **true**; the harness defaults **false**.
So B's area on the arm the card builds is **still unmeasured**, and the
experiment is runnable -- at a reduced `MAXROWS_OVR`, which makes it a valid
one-variable test of `B_STATE_AXI` even though the magnitudes are not 9B.

**THE CARD PATH REMAINS CLEAN**, from `cardooc`'s own log rather than any
harness: 0 ERROR lines, zero `zb_reg` mentions, full elaboration of
`fk33_card`.

### 2026-09-12 (earlier): C AT THE CARD'S REAL SHAPE IS 112,519 LUT, AND THE AREA IS THE MAC ARRAY

**MEASURED on the BC-250: `sim/ooc_gdnadapt.tcl` fails at HEAD**, producing no
utilization at all:

```
ERROR: [Synth 8-3391] Unable to infer a block/distributed RAM for
'gb_real.bp.zb_reg' because the memory pattern used is not supported.
Failed to dissolve the memory into bits because the number of bits (196608)
is too large.
```

**CONTROL, and it is the only reason this is attributable:** the script was
checked out from `121dc7d~1` -- the version before tonight's edit -- shipped
to the box and run verbatim. **It fails identically.** So tonight's edit did
not break it; **it was already broken.**

**CONSEQUENCE: the project's headline B blocker, 5,472 RAMB36 against 672 on
the part, is NOT REPRODUCIBLE from the harness credited with it.** Either the
tree has moved since it was taken or it came from a different script. Until
that is resolved, **do not quote 5,472 as a current measurement**, and do not
treat "B does not fit" as established.

**AND B'S AREA ON THE ARM THE CARD BUILDS IS STILL UNKNOWN.** The experiment
that motivated all this could not be run.

**WHAT SURVIVES, from READING the RTL rather than from any measurement:**
`B_STATE_AXI` selects between two mutually exclusive generates in
`rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd` -- `gen_st_flat : if not B_STATE_AXI` (the flat
all-layers state array) and `gen_st_tier : if B_STATE_AXI` (state over AXI to
HBM) -- and `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` passes **true** while the harness
defaults **false**. So the concern is structurally real and remains
unquantified.

**CORRECTION to commit `121dc7d`'s message**, which claimed the 5,472 figure
came from this harness's flat arm. The structural half is right; the
attribution half is unsupported, because the harness does not run.

**TWO WRONG DIAGNOSES OF MINE ALONG THE WAY, both retracted by measurement:**
(1) "`C_MAXPOS=131072` breaks it" -- refuted, the rerun at `maxpos=4` failed
identically; (2) "the harness and the card disagree about `zb_reg`" -- built
on (1) and premature. **I also varied TWO generics at once** (`B_STATE_AXI`
and `C_MAXPOS`) in the first attempt, after a night of insisting on
one-variable controls, which is what made (1) look plausible.

**THE CARD PATH IS CLEAN, and this is from `cardooc`'s own log, not a
harness:** 0 ERROR lines, zero `zb_reg` mentions, full elaboration of
`fk33_card`. Whatever ails the harness does not ail the card.

### 2026-09-12 (earlier): C AT THE CARD'S REAL SHAPE IS 112,519 LUT, AND THE AREA IS THE MAC ARRAY

**MEASURED, card-faithful, 0 errors** (`C_KV_AXI=true C_KV_BLOCK=32
C_N_ROT=64 C_MAXPOS=131072 C_CTXLEN=131072 C_KV_RBUF=4`), BC-250,
`report_utilization -hierarchical`:

```
ooc_cattnadapt_top   112,519 LUT   115,424 FF   301 DSP   16 BRAM   0 URAM
  gcr.gkvaxi.u_kv     25,485 LUT    20,584 FF     3 DSP            <- attn_kv_axi
  gcr.u_attn          84,918 LUT    94,521 FF   298 DSP            <- attn_block
    u_arr             55,689 LUT    39,312 FF   256 DSP            <- the MAC array
  (top itself)         2,196
```

**FINAL, every card generic set (2026-09-12): 112,549 LUT, 115,426 FF,
301 DSP, 16 BRAM, 0 URAM.** The last two unset generics were the HBM bases
`C_K_BASE_CH`/`C_V_BASE_CH`, left at 0, where zero is NOT neutral because the
address adders constant-fold away. Setting them to the card's 282598912 /
353902080 costs **+30 LUT** (112,519 -> 112,549), all of it inside
`attn_kv_axi` (25,485 -> 25,515) with `attn_block` unchanged to the digit. So
the "optimistic" caveat was right in direction and **negligible in magnitude,
0.03%** -- recorded because a caveat that turns out not to matter is still
worth closing rather than leaving open.

**C's mover is 25.6% of the part's 439,680 LUT**, and the area sits in
`attn_block`/`u_arr`, i.e. in the COMPUTE, which is where it should be.
`attn_kv_axi` is 23% of the mover. Memory is inferred properly here: 16 BRAM
tiles, `u_attn/ypre` as a `RAM_SDP 4096x24`.

**THE ENTRY THAT STOOD HERE FOR AN HOUR IS WITHDRAWN IN FULL.** It said "C's
area is `attn_kv_axi` and it is 238,410 LUT of registers", concluded the KV
interface was built from a quarter-million flip-flops with zero memory
primitives, and called that the thing to attack. **All of it was an artifact
of generics I failed to set.** Same harness, same tree, same box, the only
difference being the three generics named above:

| | wrong run | card-faithful | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| top LUT | 325,794 | **112,519** | 2.9x |
| `attn_kv_axi` LUT | 238,410 | **25,485** | **9.4x** |
| `attn_kv_axi` FF | 274,550 | **20,584** | 13.3x |
| BRAM | 16 (top) | 16 | -- |

**`C_KV_RBUF` 64 vs 4 -- one buffer-depth generic -- moved that block by 9.4x
and the whole measurement by 2.9x.** The "registers where memory was intended"
signature vanished entirely at the real depth.

**Two independent confirmations the corrected figure is the right one:** it
agrees in magnitude with the standalone `attn_kv_axi` measurement of 33,259
LUT taken earlier from a different harness, and that agreement is what makes
238,410 the lone outlier rather than leaving the standalone unexplained. **A
7x disagreement between two harnesses was the tell, and chasing it rather than
picking the number that suited the story is the only reason this was caught.**

**THE LESSON, FIFTH INSTANCE OF THE SAME SHAPE IN TWO DAYS AND THE FIRST ONE
THAT WAS MINE:** an unset generic is a claim that the default is right, and
**OOC harnesses are where measurements come from, so their defaults matter
more than the design's.** The audit recorded yesterday covered
`fk33_card.vhd` against `llama_top` and did not cover the harnesses. Worse,
`rtl/ooc_cattnadapt_top.vhd` defaults `C_KV_RBUF` to **64** where the
`llama_top` it was EXTRACTED FROM says **4** -- an extraction that changes a
default looks exactly like the thing it came from and has no tell.

`sim/ooc_cattnadapt.tcl` now exposes `CATTN_MAXPOS`, `CATTN_CTXLEN` and
`CATTN_RBUF`, with defaults that reproduce every figure taken before the
change.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE COMPOSED AREA FIGURE OMITS SUBSYSTEM C'S ENTIRE MOVER

**ATTRIBUTED INSIDE ONE SYNTHESIS, not by subtracting contexts.**
`report_utilization -hierarchical`, `ooc_cattnadapt_top`, card geometry
(`C_KV_AXI=true C_KV_BLOCK=32 C_N_ROT=64`), BC-250, 0 errors:

```
ooc_cattnadapt_top        325,794 LUT   369,197 FF   296 DSP
  gcr.gkvaxi.u_kv         238,410 LUT   274,550 FF     0 DSP    <- attn_kv_axi
  gcr.u_attn               85,188 LUT    94,351 FF   296 DSP    <- attn_block

    u_emit                     692
  (top itself)              2,196
```

**`attn_kv_axi` is 73% of C's mover and 54% of the WHOLE PART's LUTs by
itself** (439,680 on xcvu33p). The attention compute is 85,188. **The area
problem is the KV cache interface, not the arithmetic** -- and nothing was
looking there, because every composed top instantiates `attn_block` and NOT
`attn_kv_axi`.

**AND THE SHAPE IS THE REAL FINDING: it uses NO MEMORY PRIMITIVES AT ALL.**
`LUTRAMs 0, SRLs 0, RAMB36 0, RAMB18 0, URAM 0, DSP 0` -- 238,410 **logic**
LUTs and **274,550 flip-flops**. A KV cache interface holding a quarter of a
million registers and not one block RAM is this file's own recorded
signature: *"if a run reports `RAM=0 FF=1024` you have registers"*. The part
has 320 idle URAM288 and 672 BRAM tiles.

**OPEN, AND IT DECIDES WHETHER THE ABOVE IS THE REAL NUMBER: the same module
measured 33,259 LUT / 20,653 FF standalone earlier the same session**
(`sim/ooc_attn_kv_axi_card.tcl`, card geometry), against 238,410 / 274,550
here. **A 7x discrepancy for one module.** Either the two harnesses pass
different generics, or it is the cross-context effect this file already
records. **Do not quote either figure as C's KV cost until that is settled**,
and settle it by diffing the two harnesses' generics, not by preferring the
number that suits the argument.

**CORRECTION, same night, BEFORE THIS WAS ACTED ON: the 238,410 IS NOT THE
CARD'S CONFIGURATION AND THE HEADLINE ABOVE IS WITHDRAWN.** The discrepancy
the entry flagged as open is now settled, and it settles AGAINST my own
number. `rtl/ooc_cattnadapt_top.vhd`'s generic defaults are not the card's,
and I overrode only three of them:

| generic | ooc top default | what the CARD gets | used in my run |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C_MAXPOS` | **4** | **131072** | 4 |
| `C_KV_RBUF` | **64** | **4** (`llama_top`'s default; card does not override) | 64 |
| `C_KV_BLOCK` | 4 | 32 | 32 (overridden) |
| `C_N_ROT` | 8 | 64 | 64 (overridden) |

So that synthesis built a **16x oversized read buffer at a toy 4-position
context**. `POSW` is derived (`clog2(C_MAXPOS+1)`) so it followed C_MAXPOS
down. **238,410 LUT measures a configuration nothing will ever build.**

Note the divergence that made it possible: **the extracted OOC top defaults
`C_KV_RBUF` to 64 while the `llama_top` it was extracted from defaults it to
4.** An extraction that changes a default is a trap with no tell, because the
harness looks like the thing it came from.

**This is the unset-generic defect shape for the FIFTH time in two days, and
this time I walked into it myself** -- after writing the entry that says to
audit generics rather than wait for the next one to surface. The audit I did
covered `fk33_card.vhd` against `llama_top`; it did not cover the OOC
harnesses, and those are where measurements come from.

What SURVIVES the correction: the attribution SHAPE is still informative --
within that synthesis `attn_kv_axi` dominated `attn_block` and used **zero**
memory primitives while holding 274,550 flip-flops. Whether that holds at
`RBUF=4` and `MAXPOS=131072` is now the question, and it is being re-measured.

Levers already closed, both MEASURED with one-variable controls on the same
tree and box: `C_N_ROT` 8 -> 64 costs +21 LUT, and `C_KV_BLOCK` is
non-monotonic in LUT with its minimum at the 32 the card already builds
(413,341 / 325,794 / 350,326 at 16 / 32 / 64). **So neither knob touches the
238,410, which is now the only thing worth attacking.**

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE COMPOSED AREA FIGURE OMITS SUBSYSTEM C'S ENTIRE MOVER

**STRUCTURAL, not an estimate.** `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` instantiates
`attn_block` ONCE and `attn_kv_axi` **ZERO** times, and it does not
instantiate `llama_top`'s `gcr` block at all. So every composed area number
this project has quoted contains C's compute block and **none of C's data
mover**.

**MEASURED the same day, one coherent synthesis (not a sum across trees):**
C's mover at the CARD's geometry -- `ooc_cattnadapt_top`, `C_KV_AXI=true`,
`C_KV_BLOCK=32`, on the BC-250, 0 errors:

```
CLB LUTs*        325773 of 439680   74.09%     <-- C's MOVER ALONE
CLB Registers    369188 of 879360   41.98%
DSPs                296 of   2880   10.28%     (= 2*G*KV_BLOCK + rest, G=4)
Block RAM Tile       16 of    672    2.38%
F7 Muxes          53519      F8 Muxes  20334
```

`attn_block` alone was 87,340 LUT in its own context, so the mover's
buffering and muxing is the bulk of that 325,773 -- and it is exactly what
the composed top leaves out.

**MY OWN EARLIER NOTE THIS SESSION IS WITHDRAWN.** I recorded that compose4
"excludes both HBM-facing blocks, understating the fit by ~37k LUT + 32 URAM
+ 12 BRAM". The scale is wrong by an order of magnitude: the omission is C's
whole mover, not two peripheral blocks.

**AND THE HEADLINE B+C+D FIGURE SAYS SO ABOUT ITSELF.**
`hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py:16` states that TRACK DISTRAM's 217,381 CLB LUT
is *"the SUM of seven independent `synth_design -mode out_of_context` runs,
with `opt_design` deliberately not run, across FOUR different pinned trees,
none of them placed and none routed."* That is the cross-context arithmetic
this project forbids elsewhere, labelled as such at the source and quoted
downstream anyway.

**DO NOT turn this into a new total by subtraction.** 325,773 minus 87,340 is
two measurements from different contexts, not a delta; this file has already
recorded that Vivado maps the same RTL differently depending on what surrounds
it. What is established is STRUCTURAL -- the composed number omits the mover
-- and that the mover is large in its own right. **The fit question needs one
composed synthesis that actually contains C's mover, which is precisely what
`cardooc` is doing.**

**AND C_N_ROT 8 -> 64 IS FREE. MEASURED, two points, one variable.** Same
harness, same tree, same box, `C_KV_AXI=true` and `C_KV_BLOCK=32` held
constant, only `C_N_ROT` varied. Both runs print a `CATTN_CONFIG` line, so the
generic demonstrably took effect rather than being silently ignored:

| C_N_ROT | LUT | FF | DSP |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 (harness default, what every prior C figure used) | 325,773 | 369,188 | 296 |
| 64 (what the card builds) | 325,794 | 369,197 | 296 |
| **delta** | **+21** | **+9** | **0** |

**An 8x increase in rotation pairs costs 21 LUTs, 0.006%.** Today's `C_N_ROT`
correctness fix is therefore free, and the worry that the card's rotation
count would move the fit is **MEASURED and REJECTED -- do not retry it.**

`sim/ooc_cattnadapt.tcl` never set `C_N_ROT` before today, so every C area
figure in this project was taken at one eighth of the shipping rotation count.
That turned out not to matter, but it was not KNOWN not to matter.

**AREA ONLY.** This harness has no `route_design`, so no timing claim is made
or admissible from it.

**AND C_KV_BLOCK IS NOT THE LEVER: LUT IS NON-MONOTONIC WITH ITS MINIMUM AT
THE VALUE THE CARD ALREADY BUILDS.** Three points, same tree, same box,
`C_KV_AXI=true` and `C_N_ROT=64` held, only `C_KV_BLOCK` varied:

| C_KV_BLOCK | NBLK | LUT | FF | DSP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 16 | 413,341 | 376,889 | 168 |
| **32 (the card)** | 8 | **325,794** | 369,197 | 296 |
| 64 | 4 | 350,326 | 367,949 | 552 |

Moving off 32 costs **+26.9% LUT** going down and **+7.5%** going up, while
DSP scales structurally. **So C_KV_BLOCK is MEASURED and REJECTED as an answer
to C's area -- do not retry it.** LUT is the scarce resource here; DSP sits at
10% of the part.

**CORRECTION, appended 2026-09-12: THESE THREE MAGNITUDES ARE NOT THE CARD'S
SHAPE.** This sweep ran before the harness-defaults defect was found, so all
three points carry `C_MAXPOS=4`, `C_CTXLEN=4`, `C_KV_RBUF=64` instead of the
card's 131072/131072/4. The card-faithful total at blk=32 is **112,519 LUT,
not 325,794**. What survives is the SHAPE -- non-monotonic with a minimum at
32 -- because that rests on a structural argument about
`NBLK = HEAD_DIM/KV_BLOCK` rather than on the magnitudes, and the DSP model
below is unaffected since DSP does not depend on the KV buffer depth. **The
sweep has NOT been repeated at the corrected settings**, so do not quote
413,341 / 325,794 / 350,326 as card numbers. See
`docs/debugging/2026-09-12_the-harness-defaults-that-were-not-the-cards.md`.

**DSP is EXACTLY structural and the derived model holds at all three points:**
`2*G*KV_BLOCK + 40` with G=4 gives 168 / 296 / 552 against measured
168 / 296 / 552.

**A PREDICTION I REGISTERED AND GOT HALF WRONG, recorded because the wrong
half is the informative one.** Before the blk=64 point ran I predicted DSP 552
(**right, exactly**) and LUT *below* 325,794 on the reasoning that
`NBLK = HEAD_DIM/KV_BLOCK` sizes the `emin_tree` and NBLK would drop 8 -> 4.
LUT **ROSE** to 350,326. **The "NBLK drives LUT" explanation is REFUTED**: it
is right about the 16 point and wrong about the 64 point, so it is not the
mechanism, and whatever dominates LUT here is not the reduction tree width.
Not chased further, because the lever is closed either way.

This is the file's own rule arriving intact: **a quantity that is structural is
a constant and holds exactly (DSP); a quantity that scatters is not a slope
(LUT). Do not fit the second kind.**

A caution on the 74% itself: it is an isolated synthesis of a generated
wrapper top with no surrounding context to optimise against, so it is an upper
bound on that block's contribution rather than its cost in situ.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE CARD BLOCK DESIGN IS CLEAN -- 0 ERRORS, ON THE BC-250

**`--bd-only` PASSES on the card configuration: 0 errors,
`FK33_BD_VALIDATE OK`, peak 3,754 MB, ~4 min on the BC-250.** First run since
today's `C_REAL` / `C_N_ROT=64` / `C_KV_BLOCK=32` changes.

**What this buys: the long silent synthesis phase is NOT a block-design
problem.** `--bd-only` is the stage that catches packager errors, the
`natural`-port and `clog2`-in-a-port-width refusals, and address-map
collisions -- none of which any bench can reach. All clean. So whatever
`cardooc` is doing for hours, it is not a malformed BD.

**ANCHORING THE SENTINEL MATTERED, MEASURED:** `FK33_BD_ONLY_DONE` matches
**6** times unanchored and **2** anchored -- four matches are the script's own
commented source echoed into its own log. A waiter on the unanchored pattern
would have declared success at launch. Third recorded instance of the
self-match trap in this project, and the first where it was checked BEFORE
believing the result rather than after.

**OPEN, flagged not dismissed: 32 x `BD 41-1377`.** "Network address
<0x0000_0000 [256M]> is occupied by different slave segments,
`/hbm/SAXI_00/HBM_MEM00` in `/jtag_hbm/Data` and `/hbm/SAXI_16/HBM_MEM00` in
`/xdma/M_AXI`. This is illegal and must be resolved before passing
validation." **And validation then passed.** Those are two different MASTERS'
address spaces -- the same structural fact that `parse_address_map` was taught
today -- so Vivado is likely being conservative, but a message saying
"illegal" beside a clean validate is contradictory and is not yet understood.
167 critical warnings total, 0 errors.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE CARD NORMALISES WITH A RAMP, NOT THE MODEL'S GAINS

**FOUND, NOT FIXED, and it is a correctness blocker for inference on the
card.** `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` passes `NORM_REAL => true` and does NOT
pass `NORM_W_IMAGE`, which therefore defaults to `""`. `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`
is explicit about what that means: *"this ramp is what runs when it is
empty"*. So the bitstream under construction computes RMSNorm with a
**synthetic ramp gain instead of the model's learned gains**. The structure is
real and the numbers are wrong.

**This is the FOURTH instance of the SAME defect shape in one day**, after
`C_REAL` (C built as a stub), `C_KV_BLOCK` (4 vs 32) and `C_N_ROT` (8 vs 64):
**a generic whose declared DEFAULT is the SIMULATION value, so leaving it
alone looks conservative and is wrong for the card.** Four for four. The
lesson has outgrown the individual instances: **on the card top, an unset
generic is a claim that the simulation default is right for hardware, and that
claim has been false every single time it has been checked.** Audit the whole
generic list against what the card needs, rather than waiting for the next one
to surface.

**NOT fixed here, deliberately, and the reason is NOT effort.**
`NORM_W_IMAGE` is declared by its own RTL to be **stimulus, not a card path**:
*"It is NOT a weight region, a descriptor field or a packing. The design still
has no way for a norm gain to reach this unit from HBM."* Setting it would
bake every layer's gains in as an elaboration-time constant table, which is
legitimate for a fixed model but is a real BRAM decision on a part where the
fit is already the open question, and it is not the mechanism the design
intends. **Do not set it casually to make a seam comparison pass.** The actual
missing feature is a fetch path for norm gains, which is new RTL of the same
class as `B_SRC_REAL`.

**THE AUDIT THE LESSON DEMANDS, DONE: 58 generics, 15 passed, 43 left at
default, and only ONE new defect in them.** Two suspicions were raised and
both are REFUTED, which is the point of writing them down rather than leaving
them as unease:

- **`A_N_JOBS = 311` is CORRECT**, not a stale default. DERIVED at the 9B
  shape and independently cross-checked: `gen_mv4i_desc.py` records
  "311 of 311 A jobs, 0 refused" and `check_a_geometry.py` names the same
  figure.
- **`A_MEM_BASE` DOES NOT MATTER on the card path.** With `A_DESC => true`
  the generated `ga_desc` branch takes real `w_base`/`s_base` from the
  descriptor plane. The fabricated `A_MEM_BASE + j_step * A_JOB_STRIDE`
  belongs to `ga_real`, which the card does not build. It looked like a
  half-configured pair with `A_JOB_STRIDE` and is not.
- **`SMP_EN = false` independently cross-confirms today's `CAPS_FLAGS` fix.**
  There is genuinely no sampler, so clearing bit 2 was right for a reason
  arrived at separately from the one that prompted it.

Net: one new defect (`NORM_W_IMAGE`), one already-tracked gap
(`B_SRC_REAL = false`), and 41 widths and lane counts that are legitimately
defaulted. **The unset-generic risk is now BOUNDED rather than open.**

Consequence to carry forward: **a card bitstream produced before that lands
cannot be judged against the reference on `R_XN-L`, `R_XN.ffn-L` or
`R_XN.final`** (9 of the 63 captured seams), because the model's gain is not
what normalises them. It can still prove the plumbing, the sequencing and the
seam contract, which is what the current build is for.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): FOUR DEFECTS IN THE RUN GUARD, AND A VOID IS NOT NEUTRAL

**`sim:runguard` was red on every card-on file, so it was red for as long as
the card is the build target.** Not a regression; four separate defects, and
the first three were only visible once the one in front of them was fixed.

1. **The needle arm refused EVERYTHING.** `_ADDR_NEW_NEEDLES` pinned the
   engine-only spelling of the seam's `d_err` wiring, which does not exist
   with `FK33_CARD=1`. So `_arm_new` reported a missing needle for every row
   INCLUDING the unmutated control: A0 "refused the shipping address map",
   three legal maps were reported as wrongly refused, and **`MAP ALONE=0` was
   an ARTIFACT** -- an arm that refuses everything leaves nothing attributable
   to `check_bar_map` alone. The selftest was reporting its own defect as the
   address map's.
2. **That masked a REAL BLIND SPOT.** With the arm honest, A5 was **accepted
   by everything**: the engine control page moved onto the 8 KB scratch, which
   the emitted file's own comment says cost a `--bd-only` run.
   `parse_address_map` skipped every `-target_address_space` line as "HBM".
   With the card on, `eng/s_axi/reg0` is assigned at 0x12000 inside a
   `foreach sp {jtag_axil/Data xdma/M_AXI_LITE}` loop and carries that flag
   because it goes to two named masters. `SEG_SPACE` has said
   `"eng": "BAR",  # both s_axi and s_axix` all along; **only one of the two
   was ever covered.** Two further facts had to be handled: one segment may
   hold two legitimate addresses in two masters' spaces, so only HOST-master
   assignments belong in a check about what the host sees; and the master is
   the Tcl variable `$sp`, so the enclosing `foreach` binding is tracked.
3. **The tie-off teeth graded the wrong configuration**, VOIDing on a missing
   engine-only anchor.
4. **And the VOID was hiding the worst one: `check_seam_tieoff`'s verdict was
   a property of the caller's shell.** D's presence came from `CARD_ON`, read
   from the environment at import. MEASURED, same card-on file, same bytes:
   **`FK33_CARD` unset REFUSES the shipping file and ACCEPTS a re-added
   tie-off; `FK33_CARD=1` does the exact opposite.** Generation never saw it
   because there the environment and the text always agree. Now derived from
   the TEXT, and the card-on invariant is graded rather than skipped
   (C0 accepted, C1 refused).

**MEASURED after: A1-A8 refused, A0/A9/A10/A11 accepted, MAP ALONE=4,
NEITHER=0, `sim:runguard` PASS.** CONTROL on the real engine-only file from
`1380dbf`: old and new identical, 10 BAR rows, both accepted, under both
environment settings. The guard was correct for the configuration it was
written against and went blind exactly when the card arrived.

**THE LESSON, and it is the sharpest one in this file: a VOID is not a neutral
outcome.** VOID is correctly not a pass here, but it also STOPS THE TEST, and
everything downstream goes ungraded. **Three of the four defects were
downstream of a check that aborted early.** When a selftest reports VOID, ask
what it did NOT get to run, not only why it stopped.

Also fixed: `tb_fk33_seam` still pinned `CAPS_FLAGS=5` after the sampler bit
was cleared, feeding the mismatch into its P4 readback counter. My own
regression, caught by the gate.

**BASELINE_PASS STAYS AT 130.** The gate refuses the raise in its own words:
this tree has 22 rows a clean checkout does not get, so `PASS 137` is not a
clean-checkout floor and raising to it would be unreachable after a clone.

**VERIFIED GREEN.** A clean full gate at `64c7f3a`, started after every edit
landed (an earlier run was DISCARDED because `gen_pcieep.py` was edited while
it ran, and an overlapped run proves nothing about either version):

```
PASS  sim:tb_fk33_seam   54s        PASS -- a whole token ran with llama
PASS  sim:runguard        0s        SELFTEST PASS
suite sim  PASS 113  FAIL 0  NOVERDICT 0
suite tb   PASS  26  FAIL 0  NOVERDICT 0      139 passing, 0 failing
```

No peak figure for that run: the cgroup is removed when the unit exits, so
`memory.peak` read 0. That is an absent measurement, not a small one.

Write-ups: `docs/debugging/2026-09-11_the-guard-that-was-blind-to-a-real-bar-page.md`
(with a same-day CORRECTION appended for defect 4).

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE WALL IS AFTER ELABORATION, AND NOTHING IS HUNG

**RTL elaboration of the card COMPLETES. The standing claim that card builds
stall in `synth_design` RTL Elaboration is WITHDRAWN.** MEASURED on `cardooc`
(OOC `fk33_card`, shipping config, `flatten_hierarchy=none`): the log's last
three lines are `done synthesizing module` for `attn_block`, then
`fk33_llama_top`, then **`fk33_card` itself, the top**. What follows is a
silent single-threaded phase that prints nothing at all.

**And it is not hung. It is computing at 101% of one core**, measured 36
minutes into that phase with the log byte-frozen the whole time
(`utime+stime` delta 3,000 ticks in 30 s; RSS 9,526 MB). `wchan` reads
`futex_wait_queue` on the process leader and would have told you the opposite,
because the leader waits while a worker thread does the work. **`wchan` alone
is the wrong liveness test here.**

**This reframes every previous card attempt.** Three runs show the identical
two-phase-line signature and each was stopped or abandoned, not observed to
fail: `cardbb` 09-10 stopped at 121 min with no DCP (37 modules), `cardooc`
09-09 abandoned (60 modules), `cardooc` 09-11 still running (**90 modules,
top reached**). Attempt 12's "elaboration exceeds 6 h" is the same phase,
mis-named. **No card build has ever been allowed to run this phase to
completion**, so whether it terminates is now THE open question, and the
per-subsystem fallback should not be chosen until it is answered.

Do not kill a card build on the strength of a frozen log again. Read the last
module NAME, not the count, and measure CPU over a wall-clock interval.

Two traps, both mine: I read a rising module count as progress into those
modules when it was completion of them, and I asserted my own monitor's stop
rule was "the biggest threat" to the run when reading it back shows it only
`exit 0`s the observer and never touches the job.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE CARD WAS BUILDING SUBSYSTEM C AS A STUB

**The card could not have run inference, whatever happened to synthesis.**
`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` passed twelve generics and **`C_REAL` was not one
of them**, so the default `false` applied and the card elaborated
`gc : if not C_REAL generate` -- a three-state stub FSM -- instead of `gcr`,
**where `attn_block` AND `attn_kv_axi` both live**. `fk33_llama_top`
instantiates `attn_block` exactly once, at `:5893`, inside `gcr`.

`docs/PLAN_TO_FIRST_INFERENCE.md:236` required `C_REAL`, `C_KV_AXI`,
`NORM_REAL` and `B_SRC_REAL` all true. The card passed `C_KV_AXI` and **none of
the other three**.

Three consequences, each independently checkable: there was no attention on the
card; the five KV generics were **inert**, being consumed inside `gcr`; and
`gkvtie : if not (C_REAL and C_KV_AXI) generate` **tied the `kv0`/`kv1` AXI
ports off**, despite the block design wiring them through a grant to HBM.

**THE GUARD LESSON, and it is the sharpest of the day.** `check_kv_map.py`
validated all six KV generics, had no notion of `C_REAL`, and reported 23 green
rows -- and this dispatcher ADDED rows to that checker two days ago without
noticing the generics were inert. **A checker comparing two descriptions of a
thing cannot tell you whether the thing is built.**

**FIXED (`34a9ce1`):** the card now passes `C_REAL=true`, `NORM_REAL=true` and
`C_N_ROT=64`. `B_SRC_REAL` stays false deliberately -- PLAN STEP 3b records it
"has never executed past token 0 anywhere in this repository" and it needs a
conv tap history buffer that does not exist. That is new RTL, not a generic.

**ONE DEFECT SHAPE, HIT THREE TIMES TODAY.** A generic whose declared DEFAULT is
the SIMULATION value, which therefore looks conservative and is wrong for the
card:

| generic | default | card needs | how it was caught |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C_KV_BLOCK` | 4 | 32 | my own error; an out-of-range `natural` would have caught it hours into synthesis |
| `C_REAL` | false | true | reading the ARTIFACT's generic map against the plan |
| `C_N_ROT` | 8 | 64 | asking what the GENERATED RoPE table wants |

`C_N_ROT` is the subtle one: `attn_block` asserts only `N_ROT mod 2 = 0 and
N_ROT <= HEAD_DIM`, so 8 is LEGAL at HEAD_DIM 256. It raises nothing, indexes 4
of the table's 32 entries, and rotates the wrong number of dimensions.
**Now guarded twice** (`8b2aeac`): `realshape_gate.sh`'s `real_card_nrot`
elaborates it (rc=0, 1.27 GB, 1.37 s), and `check_kv_map.py` pins it to
`2*IMROPE_NPAIR` so regenerating the table moves the requirement.

**MEASURED, and it closes a gap in the fit answer.** `attn_kv_axi` at the
card's own geometry: **33,259 LUT, 20,653 FF, 0 BRAM, 0 URAM**. Its only
previous run used `MAXCTX=2048` and its own header says not to quote that as
the card's. A control at 2048 gives 32,483 LUT, so **a 64x context increase
costs 2.4% more LUT** -- the harness's "should be small" prediction was right
and my suspicion that context drove the wall was WRONG.
Neither `attn_kv_axi` nor `gdn_state_store` (4,028 LUT, 32 URAM288, 12 RAMB36)
is in `compose4_top`, which is where the project's "does it fit" answer comes
from, so **that answer understates the card by ~37,000 LUT plus 32 URAM and 12
BRAM and should be re-derived rather than quoted.**

**THE WALL HAS A NAME: `synth_design` RTL Elaboration.** `grep -c 'Finished RTL
Elaboration'` is **zero across every surviving log**, twelve attempts, two
machines. And every one of those ran with C STUBBED, so the wall exists WITHOUT
the real C. `cardreal` is the first build of the configuration that could
actually run the model; at 30 min it is at 23.5 GiB against a 26 GiB cap, above
`card13`'s 23.1 GiB plateau, as expected.

### 2026-09-11 (earlier): THE BUILD REPORTED FAILURE AT 02:10 AND KEPT RUNNING

**Attempt 12 (`cardfull`) did not finish and had already failed.** The parent
Vivado hit the 360-minute `FK33_SYNTH_MAX_MIN` bound at 02:10:47,
`fk33_assert_run_done` raised, and it exited. **The run it had launched was
still going at 06:00** -- 9 h 52 m old, 588 CPU-minutes, 5.0 cores busy,
holding 19.4 GB. `launch_runs` detaches; the parent's `error` does not reach
the child. **A build script's failure is not evidence that the build stopped.**
Fourth recorded instance of a harness reporting a fact about the harness.

**`HOST_WINDOW => false` IS genuinely in the build and did NOT clear the
wall.** Verified against the thing being built, not the repo: no copy of
`fk33_card.vhd` exists under `BUILD_ROOT`, `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl:256` adds the
repo path directly, and `create_bd_cell -type module -reference fk33_card` is a
module reference rather than a packaged IP. Necessary, not sufficient.

**MEASURED AND REJECTED: the memory cap was NOT the constraint.** I raised it
live 22 -> 28 GiB predicting memory would climb. PSI `full avg60` fell 0.10 ->
0.00, so the cap was causing real pressure -- and `memory.current` moved
**0.10 GiB in fifteen minutes**, with cores busy falling 5.0 -> 1.0 and
`runme.log` still untouched since 20:11. The job does not want more than
~22 GiB. **Do not raise the cap again expecting progress.**
The cap itself had been derived from `llama-server` holding 18 GB. That service
went down overnight and nothing revisited the number, so **a cap derived from
another process's footprint outlived its premise.**

**THE A-ONLY BITSTREAM WAS DESTROYED, and the hole is now closed.** 22,095,214
bytes, md5 `7203f6ddc20eae762e91c1261a72acf3`, 0 errors, wiped when `cardfull`
recreated `BUILD_ROOT`. `pcieep_build.sh` only *printed* "Next:
./save_bitstream.sh". It now copies unconditionally to `bit/autosave/` under a
timestamped name that never overwrites (`f0bed60`).
**The first draft of that fix was itself broken and looked fine:** line 72
`cd`s into `BUILD_ROOT` and never returns, so `$PWD` at the end IS the doomed
directory. Both forms print an identical healthy `FK33_AUTOSAVE ... md5 ...`
line; only a mutant built from the script's real `cd` sequence separated them
(fixed 1 file in the surviving tree, mutant 0). My own teeth test supplied
`PWD` and could not have caught it.

**Equivalent bitstreams survive and the hardware test is NOT blocked:**
`bit/fk33_pcieep_eng_epr_wns+0p001.bit` (21,647,330 B, WNS +0.001) and
`bit/fk33_i2cprobe.bit`, which `pcieep.sh` needs for the VCCINT step.

**IN FLIGHT: attempt 13 (`card13`), launched 07:29.** Three changes, not a
repeat: `FK33_SYNTH_MAX_MIN=1200` so the parent cannot declare failure before
elaboration can finish (12 proved it exceeds 6 h); `MemoryMax=26G` sized to the
box as it now is; and the autosave, so anything it produces survives.
Branches, written before the result: **clears elaboration** -> let it run to a
bitstream, then `save_bitstream.sh` and program the card. **Hits the wall
again** -> stop treating one-piece card synthesis as viable; go per-subsystem
(B 221.4 MHz, C 239.5 MHz, 3-4 min each) and compose at implementation.
**Dies on memory** -> the stop rule fires first; re-measure, do not re-cap.

### 2026-09-10: B AND C ARE FINE, THE CARD TOP IS THE WALL, AND INFERENCE RUNS

**Inference is DEMONSTRATED end to end.** `server/llama_server` rebuilt from the
current tree, serving `:8000`: `/v1/models`, `/v1/completions`,
`/v1/chat/completions` non-streaming AND streaming (27 SSE chunks, `[DONE]`).
Three server gate rows green (`PASS 3`, read off `OVERALL PASS n`, not the
verdict). Greedy output at temperature 0, which the model card states is
hardware-exact against the AXU3EG VHDL engine.
**Be precise: the backend reports `cpu`.** It is the bit-exact fixed-point
reference path, NOT the FK33. Card-backed inference still needs a bitstream.

**B AND C EACH SYNTHESISE IN MINUTES AND EACH MEETS 200 MHz** -- measured for
the first time:

| unit | wall | LUT | FF | DSP | BRAM | WNS | fmax |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gdn_block` (B) | 3 min | 75,246 | 52,203 | 253 | 43 | +0.483 | **221.4 MHz** |
| `attn_block` (C) | 4 min | 87,340 | 101,319 | 298 | 11 | +0.825 | **239.5 MHz** |

Seven minutes for both, against ~40 hours of whole-card attempts that produced
nothing.

**THE PER-SUBSYSTEM SPLIT IS TRIED AND REFUTED.** Black-boxing B and C moves
the wall from elaboration into optimisation rather than removing it: the card
top with both stubbed hit a 120-minute ceiling, no sentinel, no `.dcp`,
0 errors. **So B and C are not what makes the card intractable** -- the card
top itself is. Unlike every earlier stall this one is NOT the message cap:
`[Common 17-14]` appears **0** times.

**A TRAP THAT NEARLY PRODUCED A FALSE ROOT CAUSE.** The first black-box run
targeted `llama_top`, not `fk33_llama_top`. `tools/gen_cardtop.py`'s D3
transform replaces `llama_top`'s flat `NREGION*REGMAX` array with a
`region_mem` instance, so the card top has **0** occurrences and `llama_top`
has **1**. Against `llama_top` it failed in 6 minutes with
`[Synth 8-3391] Failed to dissolve the memory into bits (2752512)` -- which
looks exactly like the answer to a 40-hour wall, is real for `llama_top`, and
is IRRELEVANT to the card. Only asking which top the harness actually targets
caught it. Same shape as the recorded stale-table failure.

**VHDL DOES NOT INFER BLACK BOXES.** A missing unit is
`[Synth 8-5826] no such design unit`, because `entity work.X` is a DIRECT
BINDING; that is a Verilog behaviour. A stub entity with
`attribute black_box of <arch> : architecture is "yes"` is required. Worth
knowing before designing any DCP flow over VHDL sources.

**`region_mem` could NOT be probed** and is the remaining prime suspect: it has
an unconstrained array generic `SZ` (the per-region size table) and an array
aggregate cannot be passed as `-generic`
(`[Synth 8-78]` / `[Synth 8-318]`). It needs a small sizing wrapper -- minutes,
against the two hours every card-level test costs. That is the cheapest next
measurement.

**A-only bitstream building now** (`aonly2`, 20G cap). The card-free
configuration is the one path on this box documented to reach
`write_bitstream`, and the seam contract v2 explicitly supports a card without
D. **The first attempt was OOM-killed by MY cap**: 14G chosen from the
documented 10.66 GB with no margin, 21,699 throttle events, killed at 12:21:22.
The card-free build defaults to `-jobs 4` / `maxThreads 8` -- far more parallel
workers than the card build's ONE -- so 10.66 GB was never the number to size
against. Contained to its own cgroup; the box was never at risk.

**Next, branched before the answer:**
- `aonly2` completes -> a real bitstream exists; then wire card-backed inference
  behind the v2 seam contract.
- `aonly2` fails -> the A-only path is also blocked and the honest position is
  that this design does not build on this box without restructuring.
- Either way the card wall needs `region_mem` probed via a sizing wrapper before
  any further whole-card attempt.


### 2026-09-09 (LATEST): THE CARD WAS NEVER 9B. NINE HOURS OF VIVADO FITTING A STAND-IN.

**`hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` set SIX generics and none of the KV geometry**, so
every card build instantiated `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd`'s defaults: `C_MAXPOS`
**4** against 131072, `C_CTXLEN` **1**, `C_K_BASE_CH` **1** against 282598912,
`C_V_BASE_CH` **254** against 353902080, `C_KV_ADDR_W` **16** against 33. A
four-position KV cache with a context length of one.

**It was reported twenty times and nothing branched on it.** `[BD 41-2383]
Width mismatch ... '/card/kv0_araddr'(16) - Only lower order bits will be
connected`. The build gates on `^ERROR`; a CRITICAL WARNING is not one. So a
silent 17-bit truncation of C's whole KV address path passed every gate, and
the bitstream would have built, run, and addressed the low 64 KiB of HBM for
every head of every layer.

**A SECOND instance in the same log:** `fk33_seam` also took its defaults
(`REGMAX` 4096 / `HADDR_W` 12) against the card's 12,288-element region needing
14 bits, so host registers 4096..12287 were unreachable.

**FIXED AND VERIFIED, 20 -> 4 -> 0.** `--bd-only` after the KV generics: 4
mismatches, 0 errors. After `CONFIG.REGMAX 12288` / `CONFIG.HADDR_W 14`: **0
mismatches, 0 errors**, with `FK33_SEAM REGMAX=12288 HADDR_W=14` confirming the
property took. Each step attributable to one change.

**WHY `check_kv_map.py` WAS GREEN THE WHOLE TIME, and this is the reusable
part.** All 16 rows passed, including `C_KV_ADDR_W - 4 >= clog2(top chunk)` at
ZERO slack. It validates the KVR block in `sim/realshape_gate.sh` against the
HBM manifest and **never reads `gen_fk33_card.py`**. The guard was not weak and
not wrong -- it was correct, rigorous, and **checking a different artifact than
the one that ships**. That is the "guard that passes for the wrong reason"
class one level up: a checker over the SIMULATION configuration says nothing
about the HARDWARE configuration unless something asserts the two are equal.
It is also referenced nowhere in `sim/regress.sh`, only in `realshape_gate.sh`
-- the recorded "a script nothing schedules" pattern as well.

It now has a fourth side comparing each generic in `gen_fk33_card.py` against
the already-manifest-checked KVR value. Teeth, against the ACTUAL pre-fix file
from `git show HEAD:`: control 0 refusals, pre-fix file **5**, and
`C_KV_ADDR_W` 33->32 **1** -- that last being the state the "does it set it"
row cannot catch, and not an arbitrary mutant but `realshape_gate.sh`'s own
known-bad `real_kv_addr_short` value.

**THE MEMORY WORK IS INVALIDATED.** cardbuild8/9/10 -- about nine hours of
Vivado, three stop-rule trips and a long argument about a 24 GB ceiling -- were
fitting the stand-in. **22.40, 23.18 and 24.00 GB are not quotable for the 9B
card in either direction.** The check that would have settled it,
`grep -c '"--generic"'`, costs one second and was never run. The 22.40 GB
lower-bound correction from earlier today stands but is now moot.

**`cardbuild11` is the first build of the actual 9B design**, cap 24G, flatten
`none`, swap baseline 4,210 MB. Its memory requirement is UNKNOWN and could go
either way: wider addresses and 18-bit positions cost something, but the KV
storage was already in HBM so nothing large moved on-chip.

**Next, branched before the answer:**
- completes -> first real bitstream; run the full gate once the box is free.
- stops at the cap -> the geometry is now correct, so trimming `C_KV_BLOCK`
  32->16 or adding RAM are the levers, and for the first time those would be
  decisions about the real design.

**Open:** nothing enumerates which OTHER BD cells are instantiated with
defaults. Two were found by reading one log, and the same failure mode looks
identical everywhere. `[BD 41-2383]` is still ungated; every instance found
today was a genuine defect.


### 2026-09-09: cardbuild9 is in silent global elaboration; the length guard now has teeth

**The card build.** `cardbuild9` (`FK33_CARD=1 bash pcieep_build.sh` under
`systemd-run --user -p MemoryMax=24G`) started 23:13:51 and at 52 min is at
**19.87 GB, climbing ~48 MB/min**, `memory.events` all zero (`low 0 high 0
max 0 oom 0`), swap **3474 MB against a 3479 MB baseline** (i.e. below it),
available 6.4 GB. Its `runme.log` has been static at 23:17:25 for 49 minutes.

**That silence is not a hang, and this is how it was established** rather than
assumed: two Vivado workers identified via `/proc/PID/exe` are each burning
101 ticks/s (1.01 core), which is exactly the `general.maxThreads 2` this
configuration sets, and one worker's RSS grows ~12 MB per 15 s. Global
synthesis (`synth_checkpoint_mode None`) elaborates the whole PCIe/GT IP set
plus the 48 card sources in one pass and prints nothing while doing it. **A
buffered-looking log plus live CPU is the third recorded form of "the harness
is reporting a fact about the harness"**; the kernel's view of the process is
what settles it.

Stop rule in force, unchanged: oomd fires, OR swap grows >500 MB from the
3479 MB baseline, OR available <2 GB. A watcher is armed on those conditions
rather than polled by hand.

**THE FULL GATE IS DELIBERATELY NOT RUNNING, and here is the arithmetic.**
Available 6,403 MB now; cardbuild8 peaked at 22.40 GB unthrottled so this run
should take ~2,530 MB more; the recorded full-gate peak at `--jobs 1` is
2,181 MB. That leaves **1,678 MB at coincident peak, below the 2,000 MB stop
threshold**, so the gate waits for the build instead of running beside it.
Only the one affected bench was run, and it exited before this was written.
The gate is owed as soon as `cardbuild9` ends, whichever way it ends.

**`err_len_ovf` now actually tests its threshold** (`8abe9f7`, doc
`docs/debugging/2026-09-09_the-length-guard-was-checked-by-never-firing-it.md`).
It had been in the verdict only as "must stay '0'", and the bench's own
traffic never exceeds 4 beats against a 16-beat cap, so that term passed
identically against a guard tied to '0'. A directed phase on a SECOND DUT
instance (needed because `b_arlen`/`c_arlen` already have drivers) now drives
all five sources at 15, 16 and 32 beats plus a sticky-after-withdrawal check:
17 checks, six mutants, all killed.

**The attribution control came out unusually clean and is the point.** In all
six mutant runs every pre-existing verdict term holds -- misdeliveries 0,
`err_switch_busy` '0', `err_len_ovf` '0', switches 7619, reads 5142, writes
3352, all four per-port counters non-zero -- so the old bench returns PASS on
all six and the new phase is the sole detector for every one. Those counters
are also byte-identical to the reference run, so the added instance perturbs
nothing.

**The resolution floor was measured before it was closed, not guessed.** The
first version used 15 and 16 only, 12 checks. A mutant testing
`axlen(MLEN_W)` instead of the whole upper nibble -- which catches 16..31 and
passes 32 silently -- **PASSED that version**. The five 32-beat cases exist to
close a demonstrated hole; do not trim them as redundant.

`rtl/bc_port_grant.vhd` was NOT edited: every mutant was a copy in scratch,
confirmed by `git diff --quiet`, which matters because a card synthesis was
reading that file at the time.

**Next, branched before the answer:**
- cardbuild9 completes synthesis -> let it run on into implementation and
  `write_bitstream`; run the full gate once the box is free.
- cardbuild9 hits the cap or the stop rule -> the decision already put to Oren
  stands: add RAM (2 free DIMM slots, 2 x 32 GB preferred over filling four),
  or trim the card geometry for a first bitstream (smaller `C_KV_BLOCK`, fewer
  `A_ROWS_IF`, or B omitted).

**Still open, and unchanged by the above:** `err_switch_busy` and
`err_len_ovf` are sticky outputs that **nothing reads**. The work above shows
the guard fires correctly; it does not make anyone able to hear it. Wiring
them is an RTL change and would invalidate a build that is currently running,
so it is queued behind the bitstream rather than done now.


### 2026-09-05 (latest): THE REAL BASELINE IS -0.637, AND "DIRECTIVES LOSE" IS REFUTED

Three composed runs, **all routes clean**, all on ONE netlist
(`bram=253.5 dsp=2177`; the KV=4 cell is `dsp=1953`). Full writeup:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_the-composed-baseline-and-what-directives-are-worth.md`.

| run | KV | directives | routed WNS | fmax |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `c4base` | 32 | **all four empty** | **-0.637** | 177.4 MHz |
| **`c4nd`** | 32 | `''`/`ExtraNetDelay_high`/`AggressiveExplore`/`NoTimingRelaxation` | **-0.422** | **184.4 MHz** |
| `c4kv4c` | **4** | *(same as `c4nd`)* | -1.731 | 148.6 MHz |

**Two controlled one-variable results now stand on the same netlist:**
**directives are worth +0.215 ns**, and **`KV_BLOCK` 32 -> 4 costs 1.309 ns.**

**"Directives lose" is REFUTED.** That verdict came from comparing `c4nd`'s
-0.422 against `impl_pb`'s -0.402, a run whose artifacts do not exist.
**Best reproducible composed figure: -0.422 (184.4 MHz). Distance to 200 MHz:
0.422 ns.**

**DIRECTIVES MOVE THE CONGESTION; `KV_BLOCK` DOES NOT.**

| run | South | East | North | West |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `c4base` (none) | **L6** | L6 | **L6** | *(no row)* |
| `c4nd` (directives) | **L5** | L6 | **L5** | L5 |
| `c4kv4c` (directives, KV=4) | L5 | L6 | L5 | L5 |

`ExtraNetDelay_high` placement drops South and North a full level. Cutting
`u_arr`'s DSPs 8x drops nothing. **First positive evidence since the DSP-density
hypothesis died: the congestion responds to PLACEMENT, not to how much
arithmetic sits in the congested block.** Any further work shrinking `c_attn` to
relieve congestion is aimed at the wrong variable, measured twice now.

**THE WITHDRAWN -0.402 IS QUANTITATIVELY SUSPICIOUS.** It claimed -0.402 with
directives empty; the current tree measures **-0.637** under the same
conditions. So the vanished baseline was **0.235 ns BETTER** than anything
reproducible today. Either **the design regressed 0.235 ns in a day and nothing
detected it**, or `impl_pb` was a different netlist. Artifacts are gone, so
neither can be checked. The new `C4_TIMING` fingerprint makes this ambiguity
impossible in future.

**TOOLING FIX LANDED AND PROVED ITSELF ON ITS FIRST RUN.** `C4_TIMING` now
carries `bram`, `dsp`, `lut` and the directives on the verdict line.
Confirming `c4base` shares `c4nd`'s netlist took **one grep** instead of the
cross-referencing that had already failed four times. Teeth-tested in `tclsh`
across five states; the legacy regex still matches. The Tcl's instruction to
compare against the unrecoverable -0.402 is retired.

**IN FLIGHT: `c4ewr`** completes a 2x2. The `ExploreWithRemap`/`ExtraTimingOpt`/
`AggressiveExplore`/`Explore` set is **0.189 ns better at KV=4** and has never
been run at KV=32. If that carries over, the composed design lands near -0.233
and the gap to 200 MHz roughly halves. Four cells also allow the directive and
`KV_BLOCK` effects to be checked for **additivity** rather than assumed; three
cells cannot detect an interaction.

### (superseded) CONTROLLED. KV_BLOCK=4 COSTS 1.309 ns AND THE CONGESTION HYPOTHESIS IS DEAD

**`c4kv4c` landed: the FIRST controlled composed timing comparison in this
project.** Identical directives, identical tree, same KV=4 synthesis DCP, both
routes clean, only `KV_BLOCK` differs.

| | `c4nd` KV=32 | `c4kv4c` KV=4 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **routed WNS** | **-0.422** | **-1.731** | **-1.309** |
| **achieved** | **184.4 MHz** | **148.6 MHz** | **-35.8 MHz** |
| LUT | 263,544 | 249,376 | -14,168 |
| DSP | 2,177 | 1,953 | -224 |
| CLB sites | 49,620 (90.3%) | 46,770 (**85.1%**) | -2,850 |
| routed nets | 3,535,996 | 3,264,841 | -271,155 |
| F8 mux | 3,961 | 8,425 | **+113%** |

**HEADLINE REINSTATED, WITH A BIGGER NUMBER.** The withdrawn confounded figure
was 1.120; the true cost is **1.309**, because the confound was *masking* part
of it -- the other directive set is **0.189 ns BETTER at KV=4** (-1.542 against
-1.731). **Running the control changed the number, in the unflattering
direction. A confound is not noise that averages out.**

**THE CONGESTION HYPOTHESIS IS REFUTED, properly this time.** Controlled, the
maximum routed congestion level is **IDENTICAL in all four directions** (South
5, East 6, North 5, West 5) while `u_arr`'s DSPs fell **8x**, 14,168 LUT and
**271,155 routed nets** left the design, and CLB occupancy dropped 5.2 points.
`u_arr`'s DSP density is not what drives the Level 5/6 windows.

**And the confounded run was directionally WRONG, not merely unattributable.**
It showed South going 5 -> 6, written up as "congestion got worse"; controlled,
congestion does not move at all and the 5 -> 6 belonged to the *directive*
change. "Confounded" is usually heard as "real effect, uncertain size". Here the
**sign** of the observed change was an artifact.

**Fourth measured case of phys_opt over-promising, and the largest:** -1.123
phys_opt against -1.731 routed, **0.608 ns** given back. Four cases now span
0.428 to 0.633 and **not one was optimistic in the routed direction**.

**THE DECISION IS NOW PRICED.** `KV_BLOCK = 4` buys **5.2 points of CLB
headroom and 224 DSP**, and costs **35.8 MHz**. `rtl/attn_block.vhd:223` and
`rtl/llama_top.vhd:479` cite the same spec clause 2.1.1 with 32 against 4 and
nothing checks that they agree. **Which value the model requires is Oren's
call.**

**Still open:** what actually drives the Level 5/6 congestion -- DSP density is
eliminated and **nothing has replaced it**; and the composed baseline with all
directives empty on the current tree, which no surviving run establishes (see
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_the-composed-timing-record-is-not-comparable.md`).

### (superseded, kept for the method) THE KV_BLOCK EXPERIMENT WAS NOT CONTROLLED.

**Read this before the entry below it, which is partly withdrawn.**

`c4nd` and `c4kv4` differ in **five** things, not one. Per each run's own
`C4_DIRECTIVES` sentinel and each run's `run.sh`:

| run | KV_BLOCK | opt | place | phys_opt | route | routed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `c4nd` | 32 | *(none)* | `ExtraNetDelay_high` | `AggressiveExplore` | `NoTimingRelaxation` | -0.422 |
| `c4kv4` | **4** | **`ExploreWithRemap`** | **`ExtraTimingOpt`** | `AggressiveExplore` | **`Explore`** | -1.542 |

**WITHDRAWN:** the 1.120 ns; "KV_BLOCK=4 costs 1.120 ns"; **the refutation of
the congestion hypothesis** (congestion is a placement and routing outcome and
all four directives changed, so that hypothesis is **untested, not refuted**);
the critical-path move; the routed CLB figure.

**SURVIVES: everything at synthesis**, because synthesis does not read
implementation directives, and both runs' synthesis hierarchies confirm it --
`a_eng` **92,134 LUT in both to the digit**, `d_norm` **5,017 in both**. So
**-14,383 LUT** and **-224 DSP** (exactly `2*G*KV_BLOCK`), `u_arr` 57,927 ->
39,905, and F8 muxes **+113%** all stand. **KV_BLOCK=4 is a real area saving of
known size; its timing cost is not established.**

**CONTROL RUNNING: `c4kv4c`** -- the same KV=4 synthesis DCP re-implemented with
`c4nd`'s exact directives, so the pair differs only in `KV_BLOCK`. Synthesis is
not re-run because it cannot differ.

**What this cost, named plainly.** I wrote the "attributed to the mechanism
being discussed rather than to the uncontrolled variable" entry into `CLAUDE.md`
this morning, and then made the same error within the hour **in the document
announcing the first one**. The area controls (`a_eng`, `d_norm` unmoving to the
digit) are genuinely good controls -- **on the wrong axis**. They prove
synthesis was identical, which is why the area survives, and say nothing about
implementation. A well-chosen control on one axis reads as rigour and disguises
the missing one. Both `C4_DIRECTIVES` lines sat in the logs the whole time; the
comparison was made from memory of what the run was *for*.

**Rule: enumerate what differs between two runs from the runs' own recorded
parameters, never from the intent of whoever launched them.**

### (partly WITHDRAWN, see above) KV_BLOCK=4 COSTS 1.120 ns

**`c4kv4` landed. Both routes clean** (`nets=3264259 errors=0 unrouted=0
partial=0`). Full writeup:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_kv-block-4-is-a-cost-not-a-lever.md`.

| | `c4nd` KV=32 | `c4kv4` KV=4 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **routed WNS** | **-0.422** | **-1.542** | **-1.120** |
| achieved | **184.4 MHz** | **152.9 MHz** | -31.5 MHz |
| LUT | 263,544 | 248,727 | -14,817 |
| DSP | 2,177 | 1,953 | -224 |
| CLB sites | 49,620 (90.3%) | 46,706 (**85.0%**) | -2,914 |
| F8 mux | 3,961 | 8,425 | **+113%** |

**`KV_BLOCK = 4` is a COST, not a lever. `compose4_top`'s accidental 32 has been
FLATTERING every composed number on record.** If 4 is the correct spec value,
the real distance to 200 MHz is **1.542 ns**, the worst composed figure ever
measured here.

**Clean isolation:** `a_eng` 92,134 LUT in both runs to the digit, `d_norm`
5,017 in both, `b_gdn` differs by 3. Every change is inside `c_attn`.

**MY CONGESTION HYPOTHESIS IS REFUTED.** The doc from earlier today argued
`u_arr`'s DSP density caused the composed context penalty, on the evidence of
100% DSP occupancy in the windows `u_arr` owns. DSP in `u_arr` fell **8x**
(256 -> 32, exactly `2*G*KV_BLOCK`), CLB occupancy fell 5.3 points, 14,817 LUT
left the design, and **routed congestion got WORSE**: South Level 5 -> **6**,
East 6 -> 6. DSP density was *correlated* with the congested windows, not
causal. **What drives them is now OPEN with no candidate measured**, which is a
worse position than that doc claimed and the true one. The prediction was
registered in `fa92069` **before** the run, which is why one experiment settled
it instead of the story surviving indefinitely.

**Why timing got worse:** the critical path MOVED OUT of the array. At KV=32 it
is `c_attn/u_arr/p_reg_reg -> u_arr/er_r_reg`; at KV=4 it is
`c_attn/vhdr_reg -> c_attn/vref_r_reg`. `u_arr` gives up 18,022 LUT but `c_attn`
only 14,380, because ~3,642 LUT and ~2,051 FF reappear around it as deeper
muxing. A narrower array does the same work in more steps.

**Third measured case of phys_opt over-promising:** -1.004 phys_opt against
-1.542 routed, 0.538 ns given back. `c4nd` gave back 0.428. Quoting phys_opt
would have made `c4nd` read as *meeting* 200 MHz.

**DECISION FOR OREN, and it is no longer cosmetic.** `rtl/attn_block.vhd:223`
and `rtl/llama_top.vhd:479` both cite spec clause 2.1.1 with different
`KV_BLOCK` values, 32 against 4, and **nothing checks that they agree**. The
disagreement is now measured at **31.5 MHz against 5.3 points of device
occupancy**. Which value the model requires is a spec question, not a tools one.

### 2026-09-05 THE FULL DESIGN FITS, BUT CLB OCCUPANCY IS THE CONSTRAINT

**Nobody had asked whether shell + A + B + C + D physically fits on the
xcvu33p.** The bitstream goal has been pursued as a timing problem for weeks
while the shipping bitstream holds shell + subsystem A only.

MEASURED, all same-stage (physopt postRoute for the shell path, routed for the
composed top). Full writeup and the do-not-retry list in
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_does-the-full-design-fit-on-the-card.md`.

| resource | shell | A+B+C+D | TOTAL | device | % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LUT  | 50,999 | 263,544 | 314,543 | 439,680 | **71.5** |
| FF   | 62,065 | 245,425 | 307,490 | 879,360 | 35.0 |
| BRAM | 69.0   | 253.5   | 322.5   | 672     | 48.0 |
| URAM | 0      | 0       | 0       | 320     | 0.0 |
| DSP  | 0      | 2,177   | 2,177   | 2,880   | **75.6** |

**It fits on every hard resource.** DSP is tightest at 75.6%, LUT next at 71.5%.

**The binding constraint is in none of those rows.** The composed design ALONE
occupies **49,620 of 54,960 CLB sites, 90.3% of the device**, at 5.31 LUT/CLB.
Fitting the total needs **5.72 LUT/CLB**, 7.7% denser than this design has ever
been packed, in a design already at congestion Level 5 in `c_attn/u_arr` and
missing 200 MHz by 0.4 ns. 71.5% LUT reads comfortable; 90.3% CLB does not.

DERIVED the shell alone by same-stage subtraction of a `-cells [get_cells
bd_i/eng]` report from the full design **in the same run**. Cross-checked that
both contexts hold the same subsystem A by the exact DSP match, 1,585 in each.

Three traps recorded as do-not-retry:

- **The 109.3% summed CLB figure is NOT a non-fit proof.** `CLB` counts occupied
  *sites*, a placement outcome, and is the one row in `report_utilization` that
  does not sum. It is still the most informative row here.
- ~~**The composed SYNTHESIS figure is 350,283 LUT against 263,544 routed**, a 25%
  over-count.~~ **WITHDRAWN same day.** That compared a week-old synthesis run
  against this week's routed run and charged a week of design change to the
  stage. Same-tree measurement: `c4nd` synth **267,202** against `c4nd` routed
  **263,544**, a stage effect of **-1.4%**. Synthesis LUT is still not a
  placement result, but not for this reason.
- Deriving the shell from a synthesis A against a placed shell+A mixes stages in
  the direction that under-states the shell.

**Consequence: `c4kv4` is not only a timing experiment.** `c_attn`'s array
carries `DSPs(u_arr) = 2*G*KV_BLOCK`, which is 256 at the composed top's
`KV_BLOCK = 32` and 32 at the design's actual `KV_BLOCK = 4`. That is 224 of the
2,177 DSP, and the LUT and CLB it takes with it land in the region owning 65-95%
of every Level 5 congestion window. **The same one-line generator gap is the
leading candidate for both the timing miss and the CLB pressure.** Read the
`clb` field of its `C4_UTIL ... routed` line alongside the WNS, not after it.

Open: whether the placer actually reaches 5.72 LUT/CLB. Nothing here measures
that, and the only way to know is to build shell + composed engine, which has
never been done.

**CORRECTION, same day: the subsystem attribution table in the debugging doc was
a week stale and is withdrawn.** It came from
`hw/fk33/results/compose4_2026-08-29/`. Against this week's tree: `d_norm` is
**5,017 LUT / 2,004 FF**, not 48,501 / 133,169 (wrong by 9.7x and 66x, so D is
**1.9%** of the design, not 13.8%); `a_eng` is **92,134**, not 134,633; the top
is **267,202**, not 350,283. **The headline fit arithmetic is unaffected**, since
it used the routed 263,544 throughout. The stale table was *internally
consistent* -- its parts summed correctly and left the same 6,376 of glue as the
correct one -- so no arithmetic check could have caught it. Only the date in the
path would have, and it was not read.

**c4kv4 SYNTH RESULT (route still running, no WNS quoted or implied):**

| | `c4nd` KV=32 | `c4kv4` KV=4 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| LUT | 267,202 | 252,819 | **-14,383 (-5.4%)** |
| FF | 237,905 | 239,960 | +2,055 |
| F8 mux | 3,961 | 8,425 | **+4,464 (+113%)** |
| DSP | 2,177 | 1,953 | **-224 (exactly as derived)** |

**Clean isolation:** `a_eng` is 92,134 LUT in both runs to the digit, `d_norm`
5,017 in both, `b_gdn` differs by 3 LUT. Every change is inside `c_attn`.
`u_arr` falls 57,927 to 39,905 with DSP 256 to 32, exactly the `2*G*KV_BLOCK`
prediction. But `c_attn` as a whole falls only 14,380, so ~3,642 LUT and ~2,051
FF reappear elsewhere in it and F8 muxes more than double: a narrower array
needs deeper muxing.

**The refusal to project was worth it.** Scaling `u_arr` by the 8x reduction
predicts about -50,000 LUT against a measured -18,022 in `u_arr` and -14,383
net: wrong by **3.4x**, in the flattering direction. LEVERC48 on a fresh case.

### 2026-09-05 (latest): B CAN RUN PAST TOKEN 0, AND B'S HEADLINE BLOCKER IS UNVERIFIED

**Landed (pending the clean gate's verdict at time of writing):** `llama_top`'s
causal-conv tap history was hardcoded to zeros for every tap older than the
current token, and `u_state` was instantiated with `cv_seg => 0, cv_grp => 0,
cv_x => open, tok_adv => '0'`. The state tier existed, was tested, and was
wired to nothing. Four connections and a narrowed assert fix it.

**9 of 9 R_Y seams bit-exact** against `tools/ref9b/gdn_oracle.py`, which now
fills tap history from CAPTURED per-token QKV records fetched by capture key,
never consulting the store it is checking. Discriminating control: the mutant
that keeps the hardcoded zeros scores **3 of 9**, failing exactly the tokens
where history exists.

**NOT PROTECTED BY THE GATE, and this is the honest caveat.** `B_SRC_REAL`
defaults false and no row sets it true. A row that did is **not constructible
from a clean checkout**: `B_SRC_REAL=true` fails on synthetic weights and
passes on real ones, and the real weight image is not in git. Verified
out-of-gate; regressions in this path will be silent.

**`rtl/llama_top.vhd:66-70` is now stale**: it says the default stays FALSE
"for the OTHER reason ALONE: the conv tap history". That reason is discharged.
The remaining bar is the STIMULUS, not the tap history.

### RESOLVED: B'S -4.008 REPRODUCES, THE MOVER FITS, AND THE PATH IS LOGIC DEPTH

MEASURED 2026-09-05 against the repaired extraction (`f2bbd50`).  `-4.008`
reproduces EXACTLY at both `MAXROWS` 64 and 256 -- LUT 127,260 / FF 46,279 /
BRAM 5,472 / WNS -4.008, every figure matching the 2026-09-03 record.  So the
staleness alarm below is RETIRED: the number was stale in provenance and
correct in value.

**THE MOVER FITS** with `-generic B_STATE_AXI=true`: BRAM **5,472 tiles (814%
of the device) -> 50 (7.44%)**, URAM 0 -> 32, LUT 127,260 -> 65,044, failing
endpoints **110,298 -> 858**.  Through the generic, not the text substitution.

**AND NO DIRECTIVE CAN FIX THE TIMING.**  The path is 31 logic levels,
**77.7% logic and 22.3% route**, five DSPs cascaded through PCOUT inside
`gdn_conv`.  Driving route delay to ZERO still leaves 6.739 ns against a
5.000 ns period.  That is a closed-form refutation of the entire
strategy/directive lever on this block.  It has to be pipelined.

**RESOLVED: B'S COMPUTE MEETS 200 MHz. THE 111 MHz BLOCKER WAS STIMULUS.**
Startpoints restricted to the 52,045 sequential cells inside `gb_real.u_gdn`
give **Slack (MET) +0.837 ns = 240.2 MHz**, cross-validated by the repo's own
2026-09-03 measurement of `gdn_block` ALONE at **+0.483 = 221 MHz**. Two
independent methods, both comfortably past target.

**CORRECTED SAME SESSION: that is true of the block IN ISOLATION and false of
the composed design.** `compose4_top` instantiates `gdn_block` directly with
`cv_x`/`cv_w` as top-level PORTS and carries NO hash (`function m12` occurs 0
times; constants `1103515245`/`668265261` occur 0 times), so its census is
uncontaminated and `b_gdn` genuinely fails at **-0.402 routed**.

| B measurement | result | real? |
|---|---|---|
| `gdn_block` alone / restricted startpoints | +0.483 / +0.837 | yes, MEETS |
| OOC mover total, -4.008 (111 MHz) | stimulus | **no, discard** |
| composed `b_gdn`, routed, in context | **-0.402** | **yes, THE blocker** |

**B's real problem is CONTEXT, worth 0.885 ns**, and it is SHARED: `c_attn`
-0.401, `a_eng` -0.338, `d_norm` -0.168 -- three independent subsystems within
0.064 ns, the signature of a global effect rather than four defects. Two of
B's three numbers are now known fine or fictitious, leaving ONE real target.

NOT established: the mover's OWN logic (address generation, handshakes,
buffering) is still unmeasured -- it sits in `gb_real` beside the generators,
which own all 400 worst paths. Its worst path is better than -3.226 ns and
that is all that can be said. The next measurement is a harness driving taps,
weights and scalars from registers or memory.

**CONFIRMED: B's path IS THE SYNTHETIC WEIGHT HASH, not the datapath.** The
path traverses `DSP_MULTIPLIER U[43]` and `DSP_ALU ALU_OUT[47]`; `gdn_conv`'s
MAC is 16x16 and its product is 32 bits, so **those bits are unreachable from
it**. The only wide multiplies are `m12`'s two 32x32. All 15 worst paths share
ONE startpoint fanning out to sixteen `p1_reg[t][ln]` A-inputs at constant
depth -- the signature of `m12`'s shared first argument.

So **`-4.008` / 111 MHz does not characterise the shipping design**, where conv
weights come from memory. It does NOT follow that B is fast: **B's real fmax is
UNKNOWN**. Three documents quote 111 MHz as the headline blocker; it is
measuring a test-pattern generator.

**AND compose4_top MEASURES AN EASIER C THAN WILL BE BUILT.** `llama_top:479`
passes `C_KV_BLOCK = 4` into `attn_block`; `gen_compose4_top.py` contains the
string `KV_BLOCK` **zero** times, so `compose4_top` silently takes
`attn_block`'s own default of **32**. `NBLK = HEAD_DIM/KV_BLOCK` sizes the
reduction on C's critical path. ROUTED against routed, same flow both sides:
**-1.438 at 4 (155.3 MHz) against -0.596 at 32 (178.6 MHz) = 0.842 ns**, still
20x the composed miss. (An earlier entry said 2.436 ns; that was the
SYNTHESIS-to-synthesis delta and is withdrawn.) **C misses at BOTH settings**,
so this changes how far short C is, not whether. So `c_attn -0.401` and the
best composed result **-0.041 (198.4 MHz)** are BOTH measured on a C that is
easier than the real design. A generic passed by OMISSION leaves no line to
review and no diff to notice.
(`attn_block:223` and `llama_top:479` cite the SAME spec clause 2.1.1 with
different values, 32 against 4. One is wrong; neither is checked.)

**C ATTRIBUTED for the first time, and it is the MIRROR IMAGE:**
`gcr.u_attn/vhdr_reg[0]` -> `vref_r_reg[N][6]`, 23 levels,
**logic 2.361 ns (35.8%) / route 4.232 ns (64.2%)**, seven paths at exactly
-1.611, one per head. **Route-bound, so directives ARE the right lever for C**
-- the opposite conclusion to B, and an OOC route estimate is an upper bound.

`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_b-mover-is-logic-depth-not-routing.md`.

### (superseded) B'S -4.008 ns (111 MHz) IS UNVERIFIED, NOT WRONG

`sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py` has been REFUSING TO RUN since `5f1db1a`
(2026-09-03 16:20): nested generates inside `gb_real` broke a depth count whose
END pattern was pinned to a literal two-space indent. **It failed loudly and
was never heard, because nothing invoked it.** Measured body drift, attributed:

| generated file                | pre-existing at HEAD | from the tap edit |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_top.vhd`    | **225**              | 106               |
| `rtl/ooc_gdnadapt_ss_top.vhd` | **60**               | 82                |

`-4.008` was measured at `e9beec9` (13:11 the same day), when the extraction
was genuinely in sync, and went stale three hours later. **It was not wrong
when taken; it stopped describing the tree.** A re-measurement against a fresh
extraction is queued as `bmover-chain.scope`, gated on Vivado PRESENCE via
`/proc/PID/exe`.

**C is NOT exposed the same way** -- measured, body drift 0. Its extractor
anchors on the block's own indentation rather than counting depth, which is
immune to nesting by construction. I asserted the parallel before measuring it
and it was false; see the CORRECTION in the debugging file.

Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-05_b-mover-extraction-went-stale-unheard.md`.

### COMPOSED TOP: phys_opt reaches +0.006 PRE-ROUTE, route still running

`place=ExtraNetDelay_high / physopt=AggressiveExplore / route=NoTimingRelaxation`,
fresh synthesis from a pinned tree at HEAD. This is exactly the untried item
recorded at `2026-09-04_composed-top-routed.md:224`.

```
placed   wns -0.406   failing 147
physopt  wns  0.006   failing 0
routed   wns -0.422   failing 1066     <- clean route, 0 errors
```

**RESULT: IT LOSES. -0.422 routed = 184.4 MHz**, worse than the no-directive
baseline (185.1) and far worse than the prior best (-0.041, 198.4 MHz). 77.3
minutes. Recorded under "do not retry" in
`docs/debugging/2026-09-04_composed-top-routed.md` FOLLOW-UP 3.

**`phys_opt` reached +0.006 with ZERO failing endpoints and routing gave back
0.428 ns.** Nothing before `route_design` is a timing result on this design.

**The experiment changed THREE knobs at once** (opt, place, route) against the
prior best, so the loss cannot be attributed to `NoTimingRelaxation`, which is
the knob the open item actually named. Attribution needs three more 77-minute
runs; given the direction, spend them elsewhere.

### VOID: `compose4_top` does not contain `llama_top`

A follow-up run meant to measure the tap mux's cost in the composed top
returned **bit-identical utilization** (lut 267202, ff 237905, bram 253.5, dsp
2177 both sides). `compose4_top` instantiates `attn_block`, `fk33_engine`,
`gdn_block`, `ooc_normadapt` and the five `seq_*` units -- **`gdn_block`
directly, never `llama_top`** -- so `gb_real`, where the change lives, is not
in that design at all.

Stopped rather than finished. **Verify the change is inside the DUT before
designing the comparison**; it costs one grep of the instantiation list. Same
family as FOLLOW-UP 3's three-knobs-at-once error.

It also explains structurally why the composed top is not an inference design:
the per-unit data movers are absent by construction.

### 2026-09-05 (earlier): THE CARD BITSTREAM MEETS 200 MHz, AND IT WAS ALMOST LOST IN /tmp

**`hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh` produced a bitstream that MEETS its 200 MHz
constraint**, built with `FK33_IMPL_STRATEGY=Performance_ExplorePostRoutePhysOpt`
(the strategy knob is new, in `gen_pcieep.py`, defaulting to the old value and
validated by readback). Re-derived from the copied reports, not from the build
log:

```
WNS(ns)  TNS(ns)  TNS Failing Endpoints  TNS Total Endpoints   WHS(ns)
  0.001    0.000                      0               672531     0.009
All user specified timing constraints are met.
# of routable nets 286806 / fully routed 286806 / routing errors 0
```

**The artifact lived ONLY in the session scratchpad under `/tmp`.** The
write-up recorded its size and its timing and not its path;
`find hw -name '*.bit'` returned nothing newer than 2026-08-29, and it was
recovered only by searching on the byte size the document happens to quote.
Now preserved, md5-verified byte-identical:

```
hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep_eng_epr_wns+0p001.bit               21,647,330  201b6206...
hw/fk33/bit/pcieep_eng_epr_2026-09-05/
    bd_wrapper_postroute_physopt.dcp                       215,948,390  e1c8af9d...
    timing_summary_postroute_physopted.rpt, route_status.rpt,
    utilization_placed.rpt, README.md
```

`hw/fk33/bit/` is gitignored (`.gitignore:134`) by design, so
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_card-bitstream-meets-200mhz.md` is the only TRACKED
record that any of it exists. **A `git clean -x` takes it silently.**

**The `.dcp` matters more than the `.bit`.** The margin is 1 ps and no seed
sweep was run, so nothing shows the result is REPRODUCIBLE. Regenerate with
`write_bitstream` from the checkpoint; a rebuild is a gamble.

**Host software is green, and one of its recorded bugs is spent.**
`llama_server.cpp` carried a note that the FK33 arm "has been unable to open
its backend" and that `server_e2e.py` "has been reporting server never came
up". MEASURED today, both false: `server_e2e.py:195` now passes
`--desc-arena-bytes 159232`.

```
SERVER_E2E     PASS (0 failed)   6 chat cases + the tool-role refusal
SERVER_STORIES PASS (0 failed)   11 checks
gate --only srv                  OVERALL PASS 3 FAIL 0, REGRESSION: PASS
```

The note was corrected IN PLACE, not deleted: its CAUSE is still live
(`llama_server` deliberately supplies no default, because a silent default is
what `pl_open`'s refusal exists to prevent), only its consequence is spent.

**THE CONV TAP-HISTORY BLOCKER IS MUCH SMALLER THAN RECORDED.**
`llama_top.vhd:4636` sizes it as "a new `(KCONV-1) x qkv_dim` buffer". It is
not new. `rtl/gdn_state_store.vhd:45` already carries the CONV TAP HISTORY
(49,152 B), `llama_top:4232` instantiates it, and `llama_top:4258` already
connects the WRITE side from `gdn_job_seq`. The per-layer worry is answered by
the design itself (`gdn_state_store.vhd:139`): "Not per layer: every GDN layer
is visited once per token so all of them rotate in lockstep."

What actually remains is two connections, and `llama_top:4252` says so --
"one change lifts the token-1 refusal later":

- `tok_adv` is tied to `'0'`, so the rotation never advances
- `cv_x` is left `open`, so the stored taps reach nothing

**The real constraint is not storage.** `cvdata_p` produces `cv_x`, `cv_w` and
`cv_cw_exp` together and the store carries only taps, so wiring it splits one
producer in two; and the store exists only under `B_STATE_AXI`, so
`B_SRC_REAL` would stop being independent of it. **Not done, deliberately:**
that is a design decision with real blast radius, and the
`assert not (B_SRC_REAL and tok_pos > 0)` at `:4645` exists precisely to
refuse a plausible wrong number until it is taken.

**GATE GREEN, and it caught one of my own commits.** `OVERALL PASS 132
FAIL 0, REGRESSION: PASS` (floor 124; do NOT raise it, this tree has 22 rows a
clean checkout does not get and `regress.sh` says so). The first run was
`PASS 131 FAIL 1` on `sim:cardtop` -- appending a COMMENT to
`rtl/llama_top.vhd` left the generated `rtl/fk33_llama_top.vhd` stale, because
that hand-written file is a generator INPUT and nothing on it says so.
Regenerated in `14c43fb`; rule and root cause in `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/debugging/2026-09-05_generator-input-staleness.md`.

**THE STRATEGY SWEEP LANDED, AND THE SHIPPED BITSTREAM USES THE WORST PASSING
STRATEGY.** 8 points, implementation only (synthesis reused), one Vivado.
**299 ps spread on identical RTL**, +0.096 to -0.203:

| strategy | WNS | achievable |
|---|---|---|
| **`Performance_NetDelay_high`** | **+0.096** | **203.9 MHz** |
| `Performance_ExtraTimingOpt` | +0.033 | 201.3 MHz |
| `Performance_ExploreWithRemap` | +0.0098 | 200.4 MHz |
| `Performance_ExplorePostRoutePhysOpt` **(shipped)** | +0.0009 | 200.0 MHz |
| `Performance_Explore` | -0.0066 | misses, 20 ep |
| `Performance_Retiming` / `RefinePlacement` | -0.203 | 192.2 MHz, 9,213 ep |
| `Flow_RunPostRoutePhysOpt` | -0.221 | 191.5 MHz, 5,194 ep |

**The control validated the whole sweep:** `RefinePlacement` returned
-0.203225 = **192.19 MHz**, and this file already recorded the previously
shipped bitstream at **"measured 192.2 MHz"** (line ~167), weeks earlier and
independently.

**There is no seed to sweep.** MEASURED: Vivado 2023.2 has no `-seed` on
`place_design`/`phys_opt_design`/`route_design`, only `-directive`.

**Post-route phys_opt is INSURANCE, measured both ways:** no-op at positive
slack (EPR 0.001 -> 0.001), but +131 ps and 1,007 endpoints recovered at
negative slack (Flow -0.352 -> -0.221). **Keep it in whatever becomes the
default** -- it is what will claw back ~130 ps when B's and C's movers push
this design negative.

**LEAD:** rows 6/7 fail on **9,213 endpoints**, the same count this board
records as *"A-only endpoint bitstream's 9,213 failing endpoints still
unattributed by hierarchy"*. Same design. `sim/ooc_mover_paths.tcl` can census
it from a run already on disk.

Cross-machine identity: `docs/debugging/2026-09-05_cross-machine-bitstream-identity.md`.

**THE BC-250 IS DOWN and needs a physical power-cycle.** It completed the
cross-machine build first (that result is safe and committed). A second build
was then launched with the cap raised 11G -> 12G on a 14 GB box and it became
unreachable; not proven causal (its `wlan0` is a USB dongle) but recorded in
`CLAUDE.md`. No WoL watchdog, so it stays down until someone power-cycles it.

#### Open, and explicitly NOT settled

- **Whether `Performance_ExplorePostRoutePhysOpt` becomes the pcieep default.**
  Costs build time, buys the clock, 1 ps of margin, no seed sweep. NOT decided.
- **`RECUR_LANES` 4 or 32 for `compose4_top`.** The composed top bakes 32 into
  a 512-bit B state port where `llama_top` uses 4; 112 DSPs on the binding
  resource. NOT decided.
- **Whether to wire the conv taps** (above). NOT decided.
- **The composed top is still at -0.041 (198.4 MHz)** and has NOT been rebuilt
  with this strategy.
- **Correctness on hardware, and hardware access.** Unchanged, and outside
  what any build can settle. No agent may program this card.

### 2026-09-04 (evening): THE 9B SHAPE WAS ALREADY RIGHT, AND THE GENERATED TOP WAS STALE

Oren asked whether `compose4_top` can be used to get the real 9B shape into
`llama_top` so the full inference goal is reachable. **The composed top is
ALREADY at the real 9B shape**, MEASURED, 13 of 13 literals:

```
SHAPE_OK 13 literals agree with model_cfg_pkg (MODEL at NCARDS=1):
  attn 16x4 hd=256 layers=8, gdn 16/32 hd=128 layers=24
```

**There is no retarget to do. What there was is no gate holding it.** The
shape is hand-transcribed at THREE independent sites and only the region
file's `RG_SHAPE : shape_t := mk_shape(MODEL, NCARDS)` actually derives from
`MODEL`. `attn_block.vhd:199-206` says its four generics are "DERIVED from
QWEN35_9B" -- **the derivation is in the COMMENT and the VHDL has literals.**
`gdn_block.vhd` does not mention `model_cfg_pkg` at all. The generator
restates the same four AGAIN as Python strings. Flipping `MODEL` to
`QWEN38_27B` would move the region file and leave A, B and C at 9B numbers
with no error raised anywhere.

New: `sim/shape_probe.vhd` (deliberately NOT `tb_*`, so it is not
auto-discovered as a row) and `sim/check_model_shape.py`. Its expected values
come from GHDL elaborating `model_cfg_pkg`'s own functions rather than from
arithmetic in Python, because a guard that restates the thing it guards agrees
with it by construction.

**AND `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` WAS STALE.** Commit `11bf64b` added the
`job_index` port to `fk33_engine.vhd` and did not regenerate the top that
instantiates it. Nothing checked: `tools/gen_cardtop.py` has had `--check`
since TRACK CARDTOP and is gated; `gen_compose4_top.py` had none. It surfaced
only because an unrelated run regenerated the file and `git status` showed it
modified when the generation should have been a no-op. **That is luck, not a
gate.** Fixed: `gen_compose4_top.py --check` (M1 is the real historical file,
KILLED) and the `sim:c4stale` row. `fk33_engine.vhd` was MEASURED in sync and
stays UNGATED, because its generator takes no arguments and writes
unconditionally -- even `--help` rewrites the repo file.

**UNIT V IS WIRED**, `--wire-v`, additive and OFF by default so section 14's
`--wire` numbers keep describing what they measured.
`ELABV_RESULT OK cells=444169`, 0 errors. Controls: `--wire` output
byte-identical at 134,199 bytes, default at 123,286, and the comparison has
teeth (449 lines differ with V on).

**WHAT ACTUALLY BLOCKS FULL INFERENCE IS TIMING, NOT SHAPE.** The composed top
carries all four subsystems' compute at the real 9B shape plus D's control
plane plus unit V. Absent are B's and C's data movers, and both are short:

| piece | state |
|---|---|
| B `gdn_block` | 22 BRAM, 141 DSP, **WNS +0.483 = 221 MHz, MEETS 200** |
| B's mover `gb_real` | fits after the `gdn_state_store` substitution, **111 MHz**, path UNATTRIBUTED |
| C's mover `gcr` | fits on area (60 BRAM), **151.3 MHz**, KV-AXI arm will not synthesise |

**AND 200 MHz IS A CHOSEN DESIGN POINT, NOT A BOARD CONSTRAINT.**
`gen_pcieep.py:360` sets it from the duty identity `f_core / f_axi = 200/250 =
80.0%`. At the shipped bitstream's measured 192.2 MHz that becomes 76.9%,
which INCREASES HBM margin and costs ~3.9% throughput. So the existing
bitstream is usable as built. **This is Oren's call and has not been made.**

Full write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-04_composed-top-9b-shape.md`.

**THE NEW ROW EARNED ITS KEEP IMMEDIATELY.** `sim:c4stale`'s FIRST
clean-checkout run FAILED: `rtl/ooc_normadapt_top.vhd` was **untracked and not
gitignored**, while both its siblings were tracked. The COMMITTED
`compose4_top.vhd` instantiates `ooc_normadapt`, so **a clean checkout of HEAD
referenced an entity whose file was not in the repository** -- nobody could
have built the composed top from a fresh clone. Fixed by tracking it, after
confirming it is byte-identical to what the extractor produces from the
current `llama_top.vhd`. Swept: it was the only untracked `.vhd` under `rtl/`.

**Gate state:** working tree `OVERALL PASS 132 FAIL 0` (131 + `shapechk`;
`c4stale` took it 130 -> 131). Clean-checkout floor measured separately,
because the gate itself warns that 22 of this tree's rows are unreachable
after a fresh clone.

**RESULT, the branch taken:** synth PASSED (`elab rc=0`, `synth rc=0`, both
`C4_DONE` line-anchored), so section 14 got a COMPANION section 15, not an
edit. **And the first number was not reportable.** The V-wired top is 2,308
LUT below section 14's table -- but ten commits touched `rtl/` since
2026-09-02, so that delta conflates unit V with all of them. A CONTROL was
synthesised the same day from a tree differing in exactly one file:

| | `--wire` control | `--wire --wire-v` | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLB LUT | 270,125 | 267,833 | **-2,292** |
| CLB Registers | 237,896 | 237,905 | **+9** |
| CARRY8 | 12,514 | 12,554 | **+40** |
| Block RAM / DSP | 327.5 / 2,177 | 327.5 / 2,177 | **0 / 0** |

**Unit V costs +9 FF and +40 CARRY8 at zero BRAM and zero DSP, and SAVES
2,292 LUT.** Mechanism is an ESTIMATE (93 boundary ports internalised, 1,185
-> 1,092), not established. Confound stated in section 15: the two runs had
different `MemoryHigh` caps, so their RSS peaks are NOT comparable and no
memory delta is claimed.

**Composed synthesis is a WORKSTATION job, measured:** 16.4-20.1 GB peak, so
it does not fit the BC-250's 14 GB.

**A DISPATCHER ERROR THAT COST NOTHING ONLY BY MARGIN.** The gate-liveness
test asked "is any process's cwd inside the scratch dir". Between rows nothing
satisfies that, so it reported the gate DEAD twice while it was running fine.
Acting on the first false report, a second full gate was launched: **two gates
plus a Vivado ran concurrently**, memory reached 19.9 of 31.9 GiB. No OOM, but
that is margin, not design. The duplicate (orphaned session 1213141, six
processes) was killed by explicit pid after confirming its sid was not the
live shell's. **Liveness is now tested by SESSION ID, which is stable across
rows.** This is the project's own trap in a new place: identify a process by
what the kernel maintains about it, never by a property that merely happens to
hold at the moment you look. `cwd` is as unreliable a needle as a command
line, for a different reason.

### 2026-09-03 (night, last): THE HOST SOFTWARE IS GATED, and its teeth are 1 of 4

`server/pl_backend.c` is the driver and `server/llama_server.cpp` is the
OpenAI-compatible server. **Nothing scheduled either of their harnesses.** Both
pass; that was never the point.

**THE ROT ALREADY HAPPENED AND NOBODY SAW IT.** `server/tests/server_e2e.py`
began failing 2026-08-29 when `pl_open` started refusing an undeclared
descriptor arena: `seam_selftest.c` was updated for it, `llama_server.cpp` was
not. It stayed red for days saying only *"FAIL: server never came up"*, because
it sent the server's stderr to `DEVNULL` and could not show the refusal that
explained it. It was fixed earlier in this session (`c13976e`) -- but only
because someone happened to run it.

Two rows now exist, `sim:srvseam` and `sim:srve2e`, added by the THREE edits
`regress.sh` demands (command, plan printf, and the dispatch case in `run_one`,
which is the one its old comment used to omit).

**THE TEETH WERE MEASURED FIRST, AND THREE OF FOUR MUTANTS SURVIVED:**

| mutant | result |
|---|---|
| M4 off-by-one in `pl_prefill`'s KV bound | **KILLED** |
| M1 `FK33_SEAM_ID_MAGIC` changed | SURVIVED |
| M2 alignment refusal DELETED outright | SURVIVED |
| M3 identity comparison disabled (`if (0)`) | SURVIVED |

M4 proves the row can fail, so it is real and not decoration. The survivors are
the more valuable half:

- **M1 is a SHARED CONSTANT.** `fk33_sim.c` and `pl_backend.c` both read it, so
  moving it moves BOTH sides and the comparison still agrees. Self-consistency,
  not an oracle -- the `m7 mutant` shape exactly.
- **M3 shows T2 PASSES FOR THE WRONG REASON.** T2 is titled "a wrong seam base
  is refused by the identity read" and asserts only `pl_open(...) < 0`. With
  the identity check disabled it still fails, for a different reason.
- **M2** means T6's "four layout refusals" never reaches the alignment
  predicate in `check_geometry()`.

**So "84 checks, 0 failed" is NOT coverage of the identity read, the alignment
refusal, or the seam magic.** Tightening those three is open work, stated as
open rather than implied closed by a green row.

**Two limitations recorded rather than hidden:** `srve2e` is a NO-OP on a clean
checkout (it needs a 9 MB uncommitted `.qtk` and returns 0 without it), so it
is teeth on a developer tree only -- which is precisely where the 2026-08-29
regression lived. And a failing row's detail line is make's `Error 1`, not the
selftest's, because `SELFCHECK_CMD` is expanded UNQUOTED so `sh -c` and `&&`
cannot be used; the failing checks are in the row's log.

**Process note worth keeping:** the `count == 1` anchor guard refused a mutation
whose target line appears TWICE, and one intermediate run was discarded rather
than recorded as a survival because the mutation had failed to apply and the
run was on clean code. `make` was also verified to have genuinely rebuilt
between mutants -- three survivals is more often a broken measurement than a
weak test.

### 2026-09-03 (night, later): THE WIRED TOP ROUTES. 60.5% LUT, 75.6% DSP, 181.7 MHz.

`gen_compose4_top.py:177` said "the wired top needs its own place-and-route
run". It has now had one. The wired top was generated into a SCRATCH tree, so
the checked-in unwired `compose4_top.vhd` and TRACK ROUTE3's numbers on it are
untouched.

`C4_DONE synth wire4` then `C4_DONE impl wire4`, both `EXIT 0`.

| | post-route | device | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLB LUT | 266,138 | 439,680 | 60.53 |
| CLB register | 243,161 | 879,360 | 27.65 |
| Block RAM tile | 327.5 | 672 | 48.74 |
| DSP | 2,177 | 2,880 | **75.59** |

**Routing is CLEAN: 521,388 of 521,388 routable nets, 0 routing errors, and DRC
reports 0 errors and 0 critical warnings.**

| clock | target | WNS | failing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hbm_aclk` | 250 MHz | **+0.006** | **0** of 12,862 |
| `core_clk` | 200 MHz | **-0.502** | 5,287 of 956,041 |

**Hold was never a problem.** Synthesis showed WHS -0.100 with 402,321 failing
endpoints; routing fixed it to **+0.010 with ZERO**. The synthesis stage's
"Timing constraints are not met" is HOLD, and reading it as a setup failure
would have been wrong.

**THE CENSUS OVERTURNED THE WORST PATH, and this is the transferable part.**
The routed report lists FOUR paths for 5,287 failing endpoints and its worst is
in `c_attn/u_arr`. Counting endpoints on the routed DCP instead:

| bucket | failing | share | worst |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`a_eng`** | **4,024** | **76.1%** | -0.493 |
| `c_attn` | 603 | 11.4% | **-0.502** |
| `b_gdn` | 591 | 11.2% | -0.460 |
| `d_norm` | 69 | 1.3% | -0.439 |

`CENSUS_TOTAL 5287` matches the summary's own count, which is the check that
both measure the same population. **The worst path is in C; 76% of the work is
in A.** Only the census names the work.

**AND ALL FOUR BUCKETS LIE WITHIN 0.063 ns OF EACH OTHER.** A single broken
path leaves one bucket far worse. Four subsystems inside 63 ps is a
DESIGN-WIDE shortfall against an aggressive target, not a localised defect.
Do not go hunting for "the" critical path.

**The lead, labelled a lead:** DRC reports 2,728 DSP pipelining warnings on
2,177 DSPs (1,762 unpipelined inputs, 632 missing MREG, 334 missing PREG),
bucketing `a_eng` 1,592, `c_attn` 689, `b_gdn` 348, `d_norm` 99. Both orderings
agree A dominates and 0.502 ns on 5 ns is 10%. But that is a correlation of two
rankings over four buckets and no advisory has been shown to lie ON a failing
path. The discriminator is to pipeline A's DSPs and re-run impl.

**Also unmeasured: whether 200 MHz is needed.** 181.7 MHz is 91% of target and
no throughput requirement here has been checked against it. That question is
worth answering BEFORE spending retiming effort.

**THE CAVEAT ON THE FIT, which is not small:** `compose4_top` instantiates
`gdn_block` DIRECTLY and does NOT contain `gb_real`, so 48.74% BRAM excludes
B's recurrent state entirely and URAM is 0. The results README explicitly
refuses to add this column to the mover's own 63,905 LUT / 34 BRAM / 32 URAM /
194 DSP, because parts do not sum across synthesis contexts. **DSP at 75.59% is
the tightest resource and is the number to watch when the mover is added.**

**CORRECTION, same day, MEASURED: most of the -0.502 was the DIRECTIVES.**
A controlled re-implementation from the SAME `wire4_synth.dcp` -- identical
netlist, only `opt`/`place`/`phys_opt`/`route` directives changed, plus a
post-route `phys_opt` the default flow never runs:

| | default | high effort |
|---|---|---|
| WNS | -0.502 | **-0.090** |
| failing endpoints | 5,287 | **815** |
| achieved | 181.7 MHz | **196.5 MHz** |

**82% of the gap closed with no RTL change.** So "the design misses 200 MHz"
was the wrong sentence; the DEFAULT FLOW misses by 0.502 and the design misses
by 0.090. Same class of error as reading a synthesis estimate as a routed one.

**Timing MET at +0.016 BEFORE routing, and routing cost 0.106 ns**, so what
remains is routing detour rather than logic depth -- which points AWAY from the
DSP-pipelining lead recorded above. That lead is neither confirmed nor refuted;
it was never tested and at -0.090 may not be needed.

The census moved the same way and A became relatively MORE dominant: `a_eng`
4,024 -> 615 (75.5% of what is left), `b_gdn` 591 -> 157, `c_attn` 603 -> **42**,
`d_norm` 69 -> 1. **`c_attn` fell 14x, so the default run's worst path being in
C was misleading twice over**: C was both a small share AND the share that
effort almost entirely removes.

Still unmeasured: whether 200 MHz is required at all.

Full write-up: `hw/fk33/results/wire4_2026-09-03/README.md`.

### 2026-09-03 (night): B's data mover FITS. The blocker was one array, and it is gone.

**`gb_real` is subsystem B's data mover.** It is 614 lines of `llama_top.vhd`,
it instantiates `gdn_block`, every `llama_top` gate row has exercised it for
weeks, and it had NEVER been synthesised. The standing blocker "per-unit data
movers for B/C (~1,600 unwritten lines)" is a statement about ENTITIES. The
logic exists.

Extracted (`sim/ooc_gdnadapt_extract.py`) and built alone it needed **5,472
RAMB36 against 672 on the part, 814%**. Vivado's own RAM inference table names
the object outright:

```
| gb_real.stmem_p.stmem_reg | 3072 K x 64 (READ_FIRST) | 5472 RAMB36 |
```

3072 Ki x 64 is **24.0 MiB exactly** = 1.0 MiB per layer x all 24 GDN layers
resident at once. That is this project's own 24 MB finding, now attached to a
line number (`llama_top.vhd:3847`).

**Substituting `gdn_state_store` for that one array fixes it.** MEASURED,
`sim/ooc_gdnadapt_ss.tcl`, `MAXROWS=64`, `OOC_EXIT 0` with sentinel:

| | before | after | device |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block RAM tile | 5,472 (**814%**) | **34 (5.06%)** | 672 |
| URAM | 0 | 32 (10.00%) | 320 |
| CLB LUT | 127,260 (28.9%) | **63,905 (14.53%)** | 439,680 |
| CLB FF | 46,279 | 37,933 | 879,360 |
| DSP | 141 | 194 (6.74%) | 2,880 |
| WNS | -4.008 | **-4.008** | |

**The LUT count HALVED**, which was not the goal and not predicted: a
3-million-entry address computation is not free. **DSP went UP** 141 to 194, the
store buying area back in address arithmetic; a saving reported without that row
would be dishonest.

**`gdn_block` itself was never the problem: 22 BRAM tiles, 141 DSP, WNS +0.483 =
221 MHz, which MEETS the card's 200 MHz.**

**THE THREE MODULES BUILT THIS WEEK COMPOSE EXACTLY, and that is now CHECKED
rather than assumed.** `gdn_job_seq`'s `ss_load_start`/`ss_save_start`/
`ss_layer`/`ss_done`/`ss_err` and its `cvw_*` group map one-to-one onto
`gdn_state_store`; `b_start`/`b_busy` map onto `gdn_block`. `tok_adv` is
deliberately the caller's, being per-token not per-layer. The only signal
needing a new source is `q_data`, this token's qkv column.

**AND THE TOKEN-1 REFUSAL IS THE SAME CHANGE.** `llama_top.vhd:4316` refuses
`B_SRC_REAL` past token 0 and names exactly what is missing: *"a new (KCONV-1)
x qkv_dim buffer, 3 x 8,192 words at the 9B shape"*. That is
`rtl/gdn_conv_tap_mem.vhd`, which exists and is already inside
`gdn_state_store`. The refusal's SECOND reason -- that `B_SRC_REAL` raises the
degenerate-residual count -- is a BENCH artifact, not a silicon one: the file
says it is "A's synthetic weights" that make `R_ALPHA` physically impossible,
and that "sourcing the taps ALONE is neutral".

**WHAT IS STILL NOT DONE.** No substitution has been made in `llama_top` --
this is an OOC measurement of a generated variant. The integration wants the
`C_KV_AXI` pattern: a default-false `B_STATE_AXI` generic, top-level AXI master
ports with defaults on the inputs, tied off when false. And the measurement ties
the store's conv face off while keeping `gb_real`'s own memory 3, so it is an
UPPER bound; the real integration replaces memory 3 too, which is what lifts
:4316.

**THE TIMING IS NOW B'S TOP OPEN ITEM AND IT IS UNATTRIBUTED.** `-4.008` before
the substitution and `-4.008` after, to the digit. The write-up had guessed
`stmem` was the largest suspect for the critical path; that is now REJECTED,
measured. 111 MHz against the card's 200 is unexplained.

**THE PROCESS LESSON, which cost the first version of the write-up.** A size
sweep showed the 5,472 did not move when the buffers were quadrupled, so it was
not the buffers -- and from "not the buffers" this dispatcher concluded "then it
is `gdn_block`", wrote it up with a table, cross-checked the arithmetic against
the known 24 MB figure and got AGREEMENT. `gdn_block` alone is 22 tiles. **An
invariance argument identifies what a number is NOT, never what it is**, an
agreeing cross-check does not rescue a wrong owner, and the naming table had
been sitting in the log from the first run. Both lessons are in `CLAUDE.md`.

Full write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-09-03_b-mover-does-not-fit.md`.


### 2026-09-03 (evening): the first integration lands, and `--wire` is not "nothing is wired"

**A CORRECTION TO THIS SESSION'S OWN READING OF THE BOARD.** It was reported
here and to Oren that the subsystems are "not wired to anything". That is true
of the CHECKED-IN `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd` -- and that file is the
UNWIRED variant. `hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py` has a `--wire` flag that emits a
materially different top: `seam_a` (`a_desc_adapter`, D-to-A), `seam_b` and
`seam_c` (both `u_seam`), and `region_mem`. It is off by default for a stated
reason -- *"so the co-residency measurement vehicle, and TRACK ROUTE3's numbers
taken on it, are preserved exactly."*

So the CONTROL plane has a generated wiring. What is missing is the DATA plane,
and the generator says so at line 928: the region file's *"real drivers are the
per-unit data movers, which do not exist yet."*

**`a_job_index` also existed after all**, as a generated top-level port wired to
`a_desc_adapter.u_index`. It appears in no hand-written `.vhd`, which is why a
grep for it found nothing and why this session first concluded the wrong thing
twice. The port is `u_index`; the signal is `a_job_index`.

**WIRED THIS SESSION.** `rtl/a_job_counter.vhd` now drives it:

* `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` forwards `job_index` and `CHECK_JOB_INDEX` to
  `matvec_int4_desc_axi`. Both default so the host-driven card flow -- the one
  that produced 311 of 311 jobs element-exact -- is untouched.
* `gen_compose4_top.py --wire` instantiates the counter, drives BOTH
  `a_desc_adapter.u_index` (16 bits) and the engine's `job_index` (32) from it,
  and **retires the `a_job_index` top-level input**. That port existed because
  nothing in the RTL decided the value. Something does now.
* `job_retire` is D's `u_ack`, VERIFIED to be a one-cycle pulse:
  `seq_desc_fetch.vhd:963` drives it from `S_COMPLETE`, and every branch of
  that state assigns a new state, so the unit cannot sit there. A level would
  multi-count and walk off the descriptor table.

**MEASURED: the wired top elaborates in Vivado, ELAB_EXIT 0, zero ERRORs**,
with `seam_a_idx` and `seam_a` both present as cells. GHDL cannot answer this
-- the composed top instantiates UNISIM `BUFGCE` and has never been
GHDL-elaborable, which is a property of the existing top and not of this
change.

**AND WIRING IT FOUND A BUG IN THE MODULE.** `seq_desc_fetch.vhd:166`: *"`go`
is a level or a pulse; it is only read in S_IDLE."* D can read a level because
it leaves S_IDLE at once. The counter could not: it checked `tok_start` before
`job_retire`, so a host holding `go` high would have pinned the count at zero
and **every A job of that token would have fetched descriptor 0**. Fixed by
reloading on the RISING edge, which accepts the weaker contract.

**THE BENCH PASSED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THAT FIX** -- 122 checks, green
either way, because it had no case holding `tok_start` high across a retire.
*A green bench across a real fix is the tell that the fix is untested.* Case
added (134 checks); the pre-fix version fails 4 of them with `u_index is 0` on
every retire, the predicted failure observed. Six mutants now, all killed, each
by its own property.

The reusable form: **before connecting a signal, read the DRIVER's stated
contract for it, not the shape you expect, and where they differ take the
weaker one** -- that is the one the other end is allowed to produce.

### 2026-09-03 (later still): CORRECTION -- `a_desc_ptr` duplicated `a_desc_adapter`

**Withdrawn: `rtl/a_desc_ptr.vhd`**, committed `e01c535` earlier today and
removed in the next commit. The version-2 descriptor index work in that commit
STANDS; only the pointer module is withdrawn.

**`rtl/a_desc_adapter.vhd` already existed** -- 328 lines, with a gate row --
and already owned the address (`arena_base + u_index * DESC_STRIDE`, :213), the
`u_index >= N_JOBS` bound check (:230), the non-power-of-two stride refusal
(:127) and the AXI-Lite writes. Its own header cites `tools/hbm_map.py` on why
a hardcoded arena address became "a FOURTH model of the same address" and takes
`arena_base` as a PORT so as not to be the fifth. `a_desc_ptr` made it the
fifth.

**HOW: I grepped for the DOCUMENT's word, not the RTL's.** Three documents call
it `a_job_index`; no VHDL file does. The port is `u_index`. A null grep for one
spelling is not evidence about the design. **This is the second instance in one
day** -- the first was claiming A's weight fetcher did not exist. Both times I
reasoned from prose rather than from entity declarations. The rule that was
already written down ("a 'not done HERE' comment is a statement about ITS
FILE") was not enough. The operational version: **grep the entity declarations
for the SHAPE you are about to build -- a port of that width, a generic of that
name -- not for the words a document used.**

**The replacement is smaller and better.** `rtl/a_job_counter.vhd` does only
the thing that was missing: nothing drove `u_index`. And narrowing it exposed a
design improvement `a_desc_ptr` did not have -- it advances on **retire**, not
issue, so the index is constant across a whole job and
`a_desc_adapter:200-212`'s "must be sampled one cycle later" hazard does not
arise instead of being answered carefully. 122 checks; five mutants killed, and
Z2b (priority inverted between `tok_start` and `job_retire`) fails exactly one
check and nothing else.

Doc: `docs/debugging/2026-09-03_a-desc-ptr.md`, CORRECTION section at the end.
The filename is deliberately unchanged so the link in `e01c535` still resolves.

### 2026-09-03 (later): the A descriptor pointer is DECIDED, and B has a job sequencer

Two of the five standing blockers closed, and one of them turned out to be two
blockers that were the same question.

**BLOCKERS 1 AND 4 WERE ONE DECISION.** "A's `DESC_PTR` sourcing is an
unresolved design decision" and "`job_ordinal` is 8-bit and cannot address 311
jobs" are two faces of one missing field: D's 64-byte step header has nothing
pointing at A's per-job data. Both `DESC_PTR` and `a_job_index` were exported
as top-level inputs of the composed top rather than wired, which is why the gap
stayed visible instead of being guessed at.

**THE DECISION, taken by Oren: the card COUNTS.** `rtl/a_desc_ptr.vhd` holds
the number of A jobs dispatched so far in the current token and emits
`BASE + n*STRIDE`. No fetch, no new region, no D format change.

**AND THAT IS WHY THE DESCRIPTOR FORMAT CHANGED ANYWAY.** An arithmetic pointer
does not remove the problem, it MOVES it: it imposes an ordering contract on
the host, and an unchecked ordering contract produces a WRONG TOKEN rather than
an error. A well-formed descriptor for the wrong step passes every single check
in `S_CHECK` -- magic, version, geometry, opcode, four pads, shape -- because
**nothing else in a descriptor says which step it belongs to**. So descriptor
**version 2** stamps the descriptor's own index into extension word 3 and
`matvec_int4_desc_axi` refuses a disagreement with `EC_DESC` / `ED_JOB_INDEX`
before the array starts. Version 1 is still accepted.

**THE MUTANTS MAP ONE-TO-ONE, which is the attribution.** Three RTL mutants,
each deleting one new arm: X1 (the index comparison) fails only bench row (c),
X2 ("a v1 descriptor may not carry an index") only row (d), X4 (version check
widened to accept anything) only row (f). No row rides on another row's kill.
Four counter mutants, all killed: monotonic across tokens, live base, wrap on
overflow, sticky `err`.

**A PARALLEL COUNTER IN THE PACKER WOULD HAVE DRIFTED.** `addr` advances only
on the success path, so a refused step consumes no slot while a per-step
counter keeps counting. The stamp is DERIVED from the address slot instead,
`(addr - desc_base) // a_slot`, so the two cannot disagree -- and if the tool
ever emits a sparse table, the card's dispatch count disagrees with the stamp
and the check refuses it LOUDLY.

**BLOCKER 2 CLOSED: `rtl/gdn_job_seq.vhd`.** One GDN layer for one token: load,
run `gdn_block`, refill the conv taps, save. 39 CLB LUT / 146 FF, fmax 916 MHz.
The refill goes AFTER the unit because the taps hold the previous `KCONV-1`
columns while it reads them. **The qkv read takes TWO edges, not one** -- a
one-stage version failed 31 of 32 data checks with the count and the order both
green. `tok_adv` is deliberately not a port: it belongs to whoever knows where
a token ends, and this module is one layer.

**MUTANT D2 IS WHY THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL EXISTS.** Refilling the taps BEFORE
the unit runs satisfies every other ordering check in the bench -- every group
written once, in order, with correct data, after the load and before the save.
It fails 9 with the full bench and **0 with the control**. Without the control
the table would have credited the kill to nothing in particular.

**WHAT IS STILL NOT CONNECTED, stated plainly.** `rtl/llama_top.vhd` does not
instantiate `matvec_int4_desc_axi` at all; it instantiates the raw
`matvec_int4` and synthesises A's bases arithmetically. Nothing instantiates
`gdn_job_seq` either, and nothing pulses `a_dispatch`, `tok_start` or
`tok_adv`. **Three mechanisms are decided, implemented and verified as units,
and none of them is wired to anything.** Blockers 3 (C's mover) and 5 (unit V,
P&R) are untouched.

### 2026-09-03: the third phase lands, and B's per-layer state is complete on-chip

**`gdn_state_store` now runs THREE movers over ONE pair of HBM masters** --
mantissas, exponents, conv taps -- with a five-state sequencer and a 3:1 AXI
mux. One `load_start` moves all 1,101,824 bytes of a layer in three transfers
and pulses `done` once.

**MEASURED, composed OOC, shipping shape, 5.0 ns: 4,028 CLB LUT (2,108 logic +
1,920 as memory), 2,004 FF, 32 URAM288, 12 RAMB36, 3 DSP, WNS +1.400.** That
is the WHOLE resident state tier for all 24 GDN layers: 0.92% of the device's
LUTs, 1.79% of its BRAM, 10.0% of its URAM.

**THE PARTS DO NOT SUM, FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND NOW THE SHAPE IS KNOWN.**
3,310 + 317 = 3,627 against 4,028 measured: **+401 LUT, +11.1%**. The
two-phase composition was +347, +11.7%. Two increments of the same size, so
**the muxes are NOT growing faster than linearly in phases** -- which was the
obvious worry about going from a 2:1 to a 3:1 and is now measured instead of
assumed. Three DSPs, one `layer * LAYER_STRIDE` per mover.

**THE GENERIC CHOICE THAT REMOVED THE ARITHMETIC.** `gdn_state_axi` emits
`flat = (head*DIM + col)*N_GRP + grp`. Instantiating the conv mover at
`VAL_HEADS => 1, DIM => CONV_WORDS, N_GRP => 1` makes head and grp identically
zero, so **`col` IS the flat word address** and it wires straight to
`gdn_conv_tap_mem`'s mover port -- no multiply, no add, nothing for an
integration error to hide in. That is defect D1 applied rather than restated:
pick the decomposition so the caller never has to invert it. **Mutation C7 --
instantiating it at `VAL_HEADS => CONV_WORDS/DIM, DIM => DIM` instead, which
is the natural-looking choice -- fails 920 of 7,968 checks.**

**THE BENCH NEEDED A FOURTH TOKEN, AND THAT IS THE COVERAGE LESSON.** The
conv history is `KCONV-1 = 3` columns deep, so a three-token run never once
presents a FULL history: every conv check would have been reading a history
that was partly zeros, and a rotation wrong only when all three slots are live
would have passed all of them while the suite said PASS. `NTOK` 3 -> 4, and
`n_full` is now asserted non-zero so a future shrink cannot silently undo it.
**Coverage of the input space is not coverage of the output space**: 1,024
conv groups were checked and only **256** of them had a full history behind
them.

**Seven of eight new mutations bite** (phase skipped; conv aliased onto the
exponent base; load/save swapped; the wrong `sel` held, which dies in the
mover's own bound check; the rotation frozen; `m_r_en` left open; the head/col
decomposition). The three earlier mutations still bite against the extended
bench, so the older properties were not weakened by the new shape.

**C8 does NOT bite** -- the `busy` gate on the unit's conv write -- and it is
the third of its kind after `s5` and `s6`. The bench never violates the
ownership rule, so a gate against that violation has nothing to suppress. Kept
as defence, reported as untested. Three of these now; the pattern is that
every ownership gate in this tier is structurally invisible to a bench whose
stimulus obeys the ownership rule, and only a deliberately misbehaving caller
would exercise them.

**What is still missing is a CALLER, not storage.** Nothing feeds the tap
write port from A's qkv stream and nothing pulses `tok_adv`. `B_SRC_REAL`
still cannot run past token 0, but the reason has moved: it is now the absence
of a job sequencer rather than the absence of anywhere to put the state.

**CORRECTION TO MY OWN FRAMING TODAY, AND IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE TIER.**
I have been calling the conv tap history "the" reason `B_SRC_REAL` cannot pass
token 0, and repeating it into three documents. Reading `llama_top`'s own
header rather than the assert shows TWO reasons, and it MEASURED them:
"B_SRC_REAL defaults FALSE and the reason is measured, not conservatism: with
it TRUE the degenerate-residual count RISES, 0/3/10/23 -> 3/5/11/24 at
4/8/16/32 blocks, because A's synthetic weights make R_ALPHA's VALUES
physically impossible and gdn_scalar's gate saturates shut. **Sourcing the taps
ALONE is neutral.**"

So the tap store removes an ASSERT and changes no number. What changes numbers
is A -- and **I then got the SIZE of that wrong too, in the same hour, and the
two mistakes have one shape.**

I quoted `rtl/seq_desc_fetch.vhd:113-115` -- "The base array ... is NOT fetched
here ... Fetching it is remaining work" -- and wrote it up as "A does not fetch
its weights, and writing that fetcher is the top blocker". **The fetcher
exists.** `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd` reads a descriptor from `DESC_PTR`,
drives the core's `w_base`/`s_base` from its base array
(`dw(DESC_BASE0 + p)`), carries its own base-array bounds checks, and is
covered by FOUR gate rows: `tb_a_geom`, `tb_matvec_fk33_desc`,
`tb_matvec_fk33_desc_dual`, `tb_matvec_fk33_desc_xexp`.

What is wrong is the INTEGRATION: `llama_top.vhd:3335` instantiates the RAW
`matvec_int4` and fabricates the bases as a uniform stride
(`base + p*A_SUB_BYTES`), and its own warning says the cost -- "The per-job
weight address block is FABRICATED ... running would have read the next
sub-region's bytes and reported success."

**The genuinely open piece is where `DESC_PTR` comes from**, and
`tools/gen_layer_program.py:36` states it as a DECISION rather than a gap:
"which mechanism delivers them to the card is an open integration decision,
not a derivation." D's step table is dense at a 64-byte stride, so step i+1's
header occupies exactly the bytes step i's base array would need; the two
cannot share a block, so the pointer must live somewhere and today it does not.

**THE LESSON, TWICE IN ONE HOUR: a "not done HERE / remaining work" comment is
a statement about ITS FILE, not about the repository.** I took one as a
project-level fact about the conv taps and again about A's weight fetch, and
both times the real situation was narrower -- once because a second blocker
mattered more, once because the capability already existed and was gated.
**Grep for the capability before quoting its absence.**

**THE HONEST ORDER OF WHAT REMAINS TO A RIGHT TOKEN**, corrected twice:
1. Wire `matvec_int4_desc_axi` into `llama_top` in place of the raw core, and
   decide where each A job's `DESC_PTR` comes from. Nothing downstream can be
   right first, and the fetch logic is already written and gated.
2. The B job sequencer, which is also what feeds the tap write port and
   pulses `tok_adv`.
3. C's mover.
4. The descriptor index (`job_ordinal` is 8 bits and cannot address 311 jobs).
5. Unit V, then P&R.

Nothing in that list is software. The state tier landed today is item 2's
prerequisite and not item 1's.

### 2026-09-02, later still: both phases of the state move, the conv arena is reserved, and a standing check had been red

**LANDED: the exponent phase.** `rtl/gdn_state_store.vhd` now instantiates
`gdn_state_axi` TWICE -- once at the mantissa shape and once at
`WORD_BITS => 8, N_GRP => 1` -- with a four-state sequencer and a 2:1 on the
ONE pair of HBM masters. One `load_start` moves 1,052,672 bytes in two
transfers and pulses `done` once. **MEASURED, composed OOC, shipping shape,
5.0 ns: 3,310 CLB LUT (1,390 logic + 1,920 as memory), 1,355 FF, 32 URAM288,
0 BRAM, 2 DSP, WNS +1.400 (278 MHz).** The parts sum to 2,963, so the second
mover, the sequencer and the muxes cost **+347 LUT, +11.7%** -- the second time
in two days that a composed draw came in above the sum of its components, and
the second time neither component's own census showed it.

`sim/tb_gdn_state_store.vhd`: **4,632 checks, 512 of them exponents**, three
tokens, three evictions per layer per token.

**A DESIGN DEFECT AND A BENCH DEFECT, WITH THE SAME SIGNATURE, ON THE SAME
DAY.** Both shifted the data by exactly one element, and that is why the second
cost an hour:

* **Design.** `gdn_exp_mem`'s mover-facing read had to be REGISTERED. The
  mover collects a word TWO edges after issuing its address because
  `gdn_state_mem` is a block RAM; an ASYNCHRONOUS port presents each byte one
  edge early and the mover collects the NEXT one. That is defect D2 of the
  write-up recurring on a second port, and the fix is 8 FF on the mover port
  only -- the unit's port must stay asynchronous.
* **Bench.** After fixing that, 511 of 512 exponent checks still failed,
  shifted by one. The obvious reading was that the fix was wrong.
  **PROBE A settled it in one run**: a loop reading the exponents straight back
  through the unit port with NO DMA in between failed 767 of 768. The mover had
  not run. The cause was a relay signal inside the DUT -- `se_rdata <=
  ex_r_data` -- adding a delta, against a bench that checked the combinational
  read after a fixed `wait for 0 ns; wait for 0 ns;`.

**THE REUSABLE PART: a fixed delta count encodes a private detail of the DUT's
internal wiring in the bench.** Add one relay inside the DUT and every read
shifts by one address, and the bench reports a data error in the wrong module.
`unit_eread` now parks at a FALLING edge and waits a real 1 ns -- half a clock
period, so no rising edge can occur and the read is still proven
combinational, but the check survives any internal rewiring.

**EIGHT MUTATIONS, SIX BITE, AND THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL SAYS THE NEW CHECKS
EARN THREE.** Every mutant was re-run against the bench with the exponent
checks removed. Three (an asynchronous mover read; the exponent phase skipped;
load and save swapped for that phase only) pass the control and are genuine new
detections. Three do not: `sel_e` never asserted and `done` reported early are
caught by machinery that already existed, and **writing the exponents on top of
the mantissas is caught by the MANTISSA checks** -- it reads like an exponent
bug and is not. Without the control this table would have claimed six.

**TWO MUTATIONS DO NOT BITE AND ARE REPORTED UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES.** Forcing
the idle mover's `arready`/`rvalid` low, and gating the unit's exponent write
with `busy`, are both defensive: an idle `gdn_state_axi` holds `arvalid` low
and the bench never violates the ownership rule, so neither has anything to
discriminate against. They are kept and they are UNTESTED, and no mutation of
this bench can change that. That is the resolution floor, not a gap to paper
over.

**LANDED: the conv tap history is reserved.** `(conv_kernel-1) * qkv_dim * 16`
= 49,152 B per layer, 1,179,648 B total, now DERIVED in
`hbm_map.arena_sizes()` from `model_cfg_pkg`'s `conv_kernel`, the
`qkv_dim = 2*key_dim + val_dim` identity that `gen_layer_program` and
`llama_map_pkg` already use, and a new `scrape_gdn_conv_mant_bits()` that reads
the width off `gdn_block`'s own `cv_x` port. It went INSIDE
`gdn_state_bytes_per_layer` rather than becoming a fourth arena, so there is
one base and one stride: 1,052,672 -> **1,101,824**, total 25,264,128 ->
**26,443,776** (+4.7%). **`server/fk33_manifest.c` needed no change** -- it
reads `gdn_state_base` and `gdn_state_bytes` and nothing finer. **Nothing moves
it yet**, so `B_SRC_REAL` still cannot run past token 0, and the module says so
in its own header rather than implying otherwise.

**AND A FINDING NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR: `sim/realshape_gate.sh` was RED, at
HEAD, and had been for an unknown length of time.** Running it to check the
arena change found 10 of its rows failing. **The control -- the same script in
a worktree at `8e22ff3` -- failed the same ten**, which is what turned "my
change broke it" into "it was already broken" for the cost of one command.
Both causes were flag mismatches with `sim/regress.sh`, in a file nothing had
touched: no `-frelaxed` (10 rows, dying on
`attn_block.vhd:1065: constant "g" is not visible here`), and no
`--max-stack-alloc=0` (the `all_real` row, dying at GHDL's 128 KB default on a
256 KB object). It is now **PASS, 25 rows, 13 of them guards that must
refuse** -- and all 13 still refuse, which is the check that the fix did not
defang them. Write-up
`docs/debugging/2026-09-02_realshape-gate-silently-red.md`.

**The general lesson is in that file's section 7.** The script is deliberately
NOT a gate row, for a good reason its header states: ten of its rows must make
the elaborator REFUSE, which no testbench can express. The consequence is that
nothing runs it unless a person does, and **the repository has no record of
when it last passed**, so the honest answer to "how long was it red" is
unknown. Where two harnesses run the same tree, their flag sets are an
interface, and this interface has no check -- still doesn't.

**GATE, BOTH TREES.** Working tree **PASS 121, FAIL 0**; clean-checkout
archive with the new files overlaid and `MV4I_FK33_FILE=/nonexistent`
**PASS 113, FAIL 0**. `BASELINE_PASS` 112 -> **113**, taken from the archive
number as rule 10 requires -- **the runner REFUSED the working-tree number**,
naming 23 rows a clean checkout does not get (19 untracked `sim/tb_*.vhd` plus
the four FK33 rows needing the model set). Teeth run on the same archive tree
with `sim/tb_gdn_conv_tap_mem.vhd` deliberately omitted: `PASS 112 FAIL 0`,
`BASELINE DROP: 112 passing, expected at least 113`, `REGRESSION: FAIL`. Note
the `FAIL 0` -- nothing was red, the run is red only because a row vanished,
which is the one class every other check in that runner is blind to.

**LANDED: `rtl/gdn_conv_tap_mem.vhd`**, the on-chip conv tap history --
`gdn_conv` is a causal kernel-4 depthwise conv, so the previous 3 columns of
the whole 8,192-wide qkv stream have to survive from token to token, and
`llama_top`'s stub returns ZERO for all of them. **MEASURED: 12 RAMB36, 317
CLB LUT, 8 FF, WNS +3.831 (261 MHz).**

**IT TOOK FOUR VERSIONS AND THE FIRST COST 35,726 LUT AND ZERO BRAM.** Each
was stopped by a DIFFERENT Vivado refusal:

| version | structure | CLB LUT | BRAM |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | one array of 192-bit words, variable-offset partial writes | **35,726** | 0 |
| 2 | array-of-array of 16-bit banks, whole-word writes | -- | 0 |
| 3 | banks inside a generate, TRUE dual port | -- | 0 |
| 4 | banks inside a generate, SIMPLE dual port | **317** | **12** |

**`49 KB is 12 RAMB36` was true of the bits in all four and predicted nothing
about three of them.** Version 2 removed a real defect -- a bit slice whose
bounds are expressions is not a byte-enable -- and the count stayed zero
because a second cause was behind it (`[Synth 8-11357]`, an
`array of array of vector` is a "3D-RAM" and gets dissolved into 393,216
registers whatever `ram_style` says). Version 3 fixed that and hit a third
(`[Synth 8-4767]`, the true-dual-port template needs one process PER PORT, and
two VHDL processes cannot drive one signal). **Re-census after every rewrite;
a rewrite that obviously fixes the inference may be fixing a different thing.**

Version 4 is a SIMPLE dual port -- one write port, one read port, each muxed
between the unit and the mover -- which is sound because they are mutually
exclusive by construction, and which makes the mover-wins rule STRUCTURAL
instead of defensive. In version 3 that rule was a priority term no bench
could see: in simulation port B assigns second and simply overwrites, so
removing it PASSED 107 of 107 while being an undefined same-address dual-port
write in hardware.

**Nine mutations, eight bite.** T4 (rotate by the live `phase` rather than the
captured one) does not, and the RTL comment that justified the capture has been
corrected: it claimed a reachable boundary case and there is none, because
`tok_adv` fires only after every layer has read and written. The 2 FF stay as
defence and are recorded as UNTESTED rather than as verified. **T5 -- making
the bank read combinational -- bites on exactly ONE of the 107 checks**, the
pair that asserts the data has not moved BEFORE the clock edge. Without that
one check the wrong primitive passes, which is how `region_mem` cost 91,073
LUT.

**AND A BENCH BUG THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A DUT BUG: VHDL identifiers are
CASE-INSENSITIVE, so `for t` nested inside `for T` is the SAME name.** All 48
tap-order checks failed on the first run and the DUT was correct. GHDL says so
in one `-Whide` line that reads like pedantry --
`declaration of "t" hides constant "t"` -- and it is the whole diagnosis.

**A PHANTOM REGRESSION IN THE CHAT TEMPLATE, AND THE HARNESS WAS THE BUG.**
Re-running `server/verify_chat_template.py` as a goal check reported
`992 identical, 1045 DIFFER ... CHAT_TEMPLATE FAIL`, with the two thinking
preambles exactly SWAPPED. `git diff HEAD -- server/` was empty, so it could
not be this session's work; a direct probe compiling `qwen35_chat_render` and
calling it twice showed the C emitting **74 bytes at `think=0` and 63 at
`think=1`, which is correct and matches jinja2 byte for byte**.

**The harness was running last week's MUTANT.** `--cbin` defaults to
`build_artifacts_tok/chat_batch`, the script only rebuilds under `--build`, and
a `--build --mutate think-default` run compiles the mutant TO THAT SAME PATH
and leaves it there. Every subsequent plain run then tests the mutant and
reports a FAIL that reads exactly like a regression in `qwen35_chat.c`. Half an
hour went into hunting one.

Fixed in `server/verify_chat_template.py`: a mutation now builds to
`<cbin>.<mutation>` so it can never poison the clean binary, and a run without
`--build` REFUSES if the binary is missing or older than any of its four
sources rather than reporting on it. **Teeth-checked as a sequence**: clean
build PASS -> `--mutate think-default` BITES -> plain run PASS again. Before
the fix that third step was the FAIL.

**AND I BROKE THE ONE-VIVADO RULE, BY ACCIDENT, THE WAY IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.**
Not by deciding to run two: by launching each OOC census with `nohup ... &` and
then launching the NEXT one after reading the previous one's log, without ever
confirming the previous PROCESS had exited. A log line is not an exit. Three
Vivados accumulated -- the two register-based versions were slow precisely
BECAUSE they had failed to infer BRAM and were elaborating 393,216 registers,
so the failing runs are the ones that linger -- and with two gates also running
the box reached **0 free, 12 GB of swap in use, 3 GB available**. That is the
state described in this project's own memory-budget section, one step before
the night the machine had to be power-cycled.

Killed all nine PIDs, resolved by reading `/proc/PID/exe` rather than by any
`pgrep` pattern; memory went straight back to 21 GB free and both gates
survived. **Nothing was lost, and the reason nothing was lost is luck.** The
rule that would have caught it: after `nohup vivado &`, gate the next launch
on the PROCESS being gone, never on the log being complete.

**Next:** the B job sequencer (load state, run `gdn_block`, save state, plus
the activation movement `gb_real`'s `bp` process does today) and, with it, the
third HBM phase for the conv taps -- `gdn_state_axi` at
`WORD_BITS => 16, N_GRP => 1` -- plus whatever pulses `tok_adv`. Then the same
for C. Write-up `docs/debugging/2026-09-02_conv-tap-history.md`.

### 2026-09-02, later: the GDN state mover exists and works, and its bench found nine defects of which FIVE were the bench's

Oren widened the goal to "bitstream and inference, plus driver, server and
integration for generating output". **The survey answer is that the software
side is essentially DONE and waiting on the RTL**, which is not what I
expected: `server/fk33_transport.h` says in its own header that
`fk33_transport_open_chardev()` IS the real transport and that pointing it at
`/dev/xdma0_user` talks to the card -- *"'swap in the real transport' is not a
code change at all, it is an argument change. What is NOT written here is the
ENGINE the real transport would be talking to."* The OpenAI-compatible server
(`server/llama_server.cpp`) already has an FK33 arm with the real Qwen3.5 chat
template, a tokenizer bit-exact against llama.cpp, the prefill/decode seam and
the host sampler; it runs against a simulated card and says so in its own
`/v1/models` description. **So writing more host software now would be building
against nothing. The critical path is the RTL and nothing else.**

**LANDED: `rtl/gdn_state_axi.vhd`**, the HBM mover for one GDN layer, plus
`sim/tb_gdn_state_axi.vhd`. Bulk DMA and not a cache, because `gdn_block`'s
`st_rdata` is a registered read one cycle after the address and no prefetch
reaches HBM from there. **MEASURED on the BC-250 lane at the shipping
geometry: 269 LUT, 703 FF, 1 DSP, 0 BRAM, 0 URAM, WNS +2.670 at 5.0 ns
(434 MHz).** It is free next to the 32 URAM288 store it feeds. The one DSP is
`layer * LAYER_STRIDE` and a shift-and-add would remove it if DSP ever binds
-- worth knowing, since the composition IS DSP-bound at 2,177 of 2,880.

**393 checks per run, six geometries (up to 1,545 checks), five mutations, all
five bite.** Write-up `docs/debugging/2026-09-02_gdn-state-dma.md`.

**THE LESSON IS THE DEFECT SPLIT: nine found, and FIVE were in the BENCH.**
Every one of those five presented as a design bug -- all zeros, all 'X', a
one-beat shift, a WLAST violation. Named in the write-up as B1..B5. Two are
repeats of traps this repository already documents and I broke anyway on the
same day I read them: **`while busy = '1'` after a start pulse completes
INSTANTLY** (llama_top's own S_ARM comment says so; 384 of 390 checks failed
with the store reading zeros), and **two processes driving one resolved signal
resolve rather than take turns** (the same defect fixed in `f_lost` that
morning).

**B5 is the one worth carrying forward.** A BRESP-completeness check was
written specifically to kill mutant M2 (a save that reports done before its
writes retire), added, and **M2 still passed** -- because the slave model
answered B in one cycle, so every response was in hand by the time `done`
reached the stimulus. The check existed and did not discriminate. A 6-cycle
write-response latency is what turned it into a check. **A check written for a
mutant, that the mutant survives, is exactly the shape of a guard that passes
for the wrong reason, and the only way to know is to re-run the mutant AFTER
adding the check.**

**Two design defects were found ONLY by the parameter sweep and cannot fire at
the shipping numbers:** a `LAYER_STRIDE` that is not a whole number of beats
(layers 0 and 1 correct, layer 2 wrong) and unbounded outstanding AW. The real
stride is aligned (1,052,672 / 32 = 32,896) so neither is reachable today.
**A defect the shipping parameters happen to avoid is still a defect**, because
the next shape change reaches it silently.

**Census filter trap, again:** `get_cells -hier -filter {PRIMITIVE_GROUP == LUT}`
returns **0** in this Vivado on a design whose own `report_utilization` says
269 in the same run. Fixed to `REF_NAME =~ LUT*` / `FD*` in both OOC scripts.
**A census that reports zero reads as a tiny module, not as a broken filter.**

**COMPOSED CENSUS: 497 LUT, 708 FF, 32 URAM288, 1 DSP, WNS +1.400 at 5.0 ns.**
**The parts do NOT sum** -- the arbiter costs +228 LUT and 1.15 ns that neither
component's own census shows. That is the "separately-measured units do not
share" assumption being tested and coming back NO; it is small (0.11% of the
device) but a budget built from the component numbers would have been 228 LUT
short. Also: the object census says 548 LUT and `report_utilization` says 497.
Both are right -- PRIMITIVES versus SITES -- and **the site count is the budget
number**, which is also what the per-module figures were, so they are
comparable. Quoting 548 against them would have overstated by 10%.

**THE EXPONENT STORE LANDED TOO, AND IT CORRECTED HOW I HAVE BEEN MEASURING
AREA ALL SESSION.** `rtl/gdn_exp_mem.vhd` is one layer's state exponents,
4,096 bytes, exactly `gdn_state_exp_bytes_per_layer`. **It cannot be BRAM or
URAM and that is not a preference**: `gdn_block:317` labels the port
"COMBINATIONAL read", drives the address combinationally (:632-633) and
consumes it on the SAME edge (:1203); both alternatives have registered reads.
That is the `region_mem` lesson recurring -- one combinational port turned that
store into 91,073 LUT and zero BRAM. Its bench checks the read **without
advancing time** (drive the address, wait two deltas, the data must already be
right), which a registered read cannot pass; all three mutations bite,
including that one at 31 failures.

**THE MEASUREMENT CORRECTION, and it is the most reusable thing here.** The
object census said **550 LUT**; `report_utilization` said **2,466**. Wrong by
**4.5x**, not the 10% gap seen earlier on ordinary logic.
`get_cells -filter {REF_NAME =~ LUT*}` **does not see distributed RAM at all**
-- it counted 546 logic LUTs and missed the memory; the separate `RAM64M8`
count of 384 is a correct primitive count and a useless budget number, because
**each RAM64M8 occupies FIVE LUT sites** (1,920 / 384 = 5).

**The rule that survives all three census defects found today:
`CLB LUTs` from `report_utilization` is the budget number. An object census
answers "which primitive did I get", not "what does it cost".** All four OOC
scripts are annotated. The earlier figures in this session are unaffected --
269 and 497 are site counts and none of those designs contains distributed RAM.

**And the attribute question came out OPPOSITE to the mantissa store.** For
`gdn_exp_mem`, `ram_style = "distributed"` and `"auto"` are byte-identical, so
the attribute earns nothing; for `gdn_state_mem`, `auto` gave 228 BRAM and the
`ultra` attribute was the difference between fitting and not. **Two stores in
one subsystem, opposite answers, neither guessable from the other.**

**GATE FLOOR: 108 -> 112**, measured as a full-tree number on a clean archive
(`OVERALL PASS 112 ... matches the recorded floor of 112`) and **shown to fire**
by a teeth run (`BASELINE DROP: 111 passing, expected at least 112`).
**It drifted mid-session and that is recorded in the comment**: it was set to
111, then a fourth row was added an hour later and the 111 went stale. Rule
10's failure mode arriving from inside one session rather than across a clone.

**PROCESS MISTAKE, AND IT IS NOT THE ONE I FIRST WROTE DOWN.** I edited
`sim/regress.sh` while a full gate was running from it, reasoned that bash
reads scripts by file offset so a length-changing edit could corrupt the run,
and discarded a 124-row gate on that basis.

**The reasoning is right in general and WRONG HERE, because `regress.sh`
already guards against exactly this and says so.** At `:337` it takes a
private `mktemp` copy of itself, `bash -n` checks the copy, and re-execs it --
with a comment naming the very hazard ("a half-written source ... re-execing
it would produce exactly the failure this guard exists to prevent"). The
running gate was reading `/tmp/regress-self.*.sh`, not the file I edited, and
was immune by construction.

So the discard cost about 25 minutes for nothing. **The lesson is not "never
edit the harness mid-run" -- it is that I applied a general principle without
checking whether this specific harness already handled it, and the check was
one `grep` away in the file I had just edited.** Being cautious is not the
same as being correct, and an unnecessary discard is a real cost, not a free
safety margin.

**STILL MISSING for B:** the per-layer state EXPONENTS (4,096 B, reserved in
the arena, no mover), the conv tap history (49,152 B per layer, **no arena
reservation at all**), and the mux between the DMA's store ports and
`gdn_block`'s `st_*` ports, which is described and not written.


### 2026-09-02, session: the B data mover is NOT a port, because B's state does not fit the device

**Oren asked what remains to flash a bitstream, and chose the B/C data movers
as the next step. Sizing them first changed what they are.**

**THE FINDING, MEASURED** by elaborating this repository's own shape functions
against `QWEN35_9B` under GHDL (not hand arithmetic):
**the Gated DeltaNet recurrent state for all 24 GDN layers is 201,326,592 bits
= 24.0 MB, against 14.2 MB of BRAM plus URAM on the entire `xcvu33p`.** It
overruns every on-chip memory the part has by **1.69x**, with nothing left for
anything else. Write-up
`docs/debugging/2026-09-02_gdn-state-does-not-fit-on-chip.md`; the plan gains
`STEP 3b`.

**So "port `gb_real`'s 635 lines" is WITHDRAWN as the description of this
work.** That framing was written from a line count and never from a sizing.
`gb_real`'s `stmem` is a process variable holding every layer at once, which is
a correct simulation model and cannot become hardware. **A data mover's cost is
in what it moves, and that is not visible in its source: the offending array is
three lines long.**

**ONE layer is 1.0 MB and does fit**, so the design is one layer resident
on-chip streamed to and from HBM per job, 24 jobs per token, DERIVED 50.4 MB of
HBM traffic per token. `rtl/attn_kv_axi.vhd` is the existing precedent and
should be followed rather than reinvented.

**The lane count cannot be swept out of this.** `NBR = DIM/RECUR_LANES` and the
word is `RECUR_LANES*16` wide, so the lane term cancels exactly. `llama_top`'s
own comment says the same independently. Do not retry.

**A SECOND piece of new RTL is required regardless: the conv tap history.**
`llama_top` holds none, and refuses rather than computing a wrong number, so
**`B_SRC_REAL` -- the mode the card must run in -- has never executed past
token 0 anywhere in this repository.**

**LANDED, and the census answered it.** `rtl/gdn_state_mem.vhd` (one layer,
`ram_style` a generic) censused OOC on the **BC-250 lane**
(`sim/ooc_gdn_state.tcl`, three points), workstation lane on the GHDL gate, no
Vivado on this box:

| `ram_style` | URAM288 | RAMB36 | share |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `"ultra"` | **32** | 0 | 10.0% of 320 URAM, WNS +2.549 at 5.0 ns |
| `"block"` | 0 | **228** | 33.9% of 672 BRAM |
| `"auto"` (no attribute) | 0 | **228** | 33.9% of 672 BRAM |

**THE HEADLINE IS THE THIRD ROW: Vivado picks BRAM on its own and never URAM.**
Without an explicit `ram_style = "ultra"` this store silently costs 228 tiles;
against the wired `compose4_top`'s 327.5 that is 82.7% of the device **before**
the 171-tile gain image, which would put it over. With `ultra` the BRAM column
does not move at all and it spends 32 of 320 idle URAM. **The attribute is the
difference between fitting and not, and it is the first use found for the
URAM.**

**Predictions scored: 32 URAM was EXACT, 256 RAMB36 was WRONG (228).** The
width-quantisation rule bit the URAM case and not the BRAM case, and there was
no way to tell which in advance -- two methods, one right each. The census is
what settles it, not either rule.

**MEASUREMENT TRAP, recorded because it reached a CSV:** the census script's
WNS comes from a `regexp` over `report_timing_summary` with `0.0` as the
initialiser. It matched for `ultra` and NOT for the other two, so those rows
carry `wns 0.0, fmax 200.0` -- **the default wearing the shape of a
measurement**, in the same column as a real one. Only the `ultra` timing figure
is quotable. Two more columns (`LUTasRAM`, `LUT`, `FF`) are filter bugs
(`REF_NAME =~ RAM*` also matches `RAMB36E2`) and were discarded rather than
reported.

**AND THE HBM SIDE IS ALREADY ALLOCATED, which de-risks the rest.**
`tools/hbm_map.py::arena_sizes()` derives, and `tools/pack_model_fk33.py`
already reserves, `gdn_state_mant_bytes_per_layer = 1,048,576` /
`gdn_state_exp_bytes_per_layer = 4,096` / 24 layers / 25,264,128 B total.
**1,048,576 bytes is 8,388,608 bits: the same number measured from the shape
functions, to the byte, by a different tool for a different purpose.** Three
independent derivations now agree. The architecture was always "the state lives
in HBM"; only the RTL that moves it is missing. **Except the conv tap history,
which nothing reserves** -- 49,152 B per layer, 1.125 MB total -- and it must
be added to `arena_sizes()` rather than quietly placed, because this address
space has already had one silent two-allocator collision whose symptom was a
wrong token.

**The new memory has an oracle, and three of its first four mutants SURVIVED.**
`sim/tb_gdn_state_mem.vhd` compares against a model coded from `llama_top`'s
`stmem_p`, not from the DUT. First version: 2,825 checks, 0 mismatches, and
nearly worthless. M2 (transposed read address) died; **M1 (write before read),
M3 (read ungated) and M4 (write ungated) all lived.** M1 lives correctly and
permanently -- `mem` is a SIGNAL, so read-old is structural and the ordering
this file's header claimed was load-bearing is not, which corrected the RTL
comment. M3 was invisible because the comparison only looked at cycles where
the reference had also read; M4 because the stimulus let the write port HOLD
while `w_en` was low, so the unwanted write was a no-op. **A stimulus that
holds its inputs cannot see a missing enable.** Hardened: 4,323 checks, M2/M3/M4
all dead. **Attribution control: the two fixes are orthogonal** -- every-cycle
comparison alone catches M3 and not M4 (130 vs 0), scrambled ports alone catch
M4 and not M3 (1,325 vs 0). Neither alone would have been enough and it would
have looked improved either way. **Bench reach measured, not assumed: it runs
at 65,536 words (real DIM, real lanes, half the head count) under a 6 GB cap
and DIED at the real 131,072 under 8 GB. No simulation here has exercised this
memory at the 9B head count.**

**ALSO LANDED, and its attribution control is the interesting part:** `f_lost`
had **three drivers** (`ap`, `bp`, `cp` each assigning the resolved
`std_logic`). MEASURED with a standalone three-driver GHDL model: one driver
at '1' against two initial '0's resolves to **'X', not '1'**. Now one signal
per adapter, OR-ed once. **The attribution control says this earns NOTHING in
detection:** mutant M1 (`bp` reports a lost beat on every y element) kills
`tb_llama_top`, `_real`, `_normw` and `_seq` identically with and without the
split, because those rows assert `err_lost_beat = '0' severity failure` and 'X'
is not '0'. It is here because the reported VALUE becomes correct and because
**multiple drivers are not synthesisable**, which blocked lifting any adapter
onto the card. My first draft of the comment claimed it fixed a dead `fail`
counter in `tb_llama_top_smp`; that claim is **wrong and was corrected in
place** -- that row runs `B_BEHAV => true`, so `ga_real` is its only driver and
the value there was already a clean '1'. The fragility was latent, not live.


Written to survive a context compaction. Every figure here is MEASURED unless
labelled, and several supersede figures still standing elsewhere in this file.

### 2026-08-31, dispatcher (new session): the overnight session died on the API limit one message before landing GAIN16. This entry catches the board up

**How the session ended, and why the tree was dirty.** At 00:42:52 MDT the
weekly API limit fired **one message after the dispatcher resumed TRACK GAIN16
with "Block on swcb properly, then land".** GAIN16's agent failed before it
could commit; ROUTE2's agent failed at 00:51 with all of its commits already
in; the gate-floor teeth Run B background job was killed at 01:05. So from
`3b2003c` (the entry below) to now, the record lived only in `git log` and in
`docs/debugging/`, and GAIN16's entire result sat uncommitted in the working
tree. **A second harness may enter this repo (Oren, 00:30 UTC): the tag
`v2.0-fk33-matvec` at `3f1235c` is the known-good rollback point Oren asked
for.** `docs/PLAN_TO_FIRST_INFERENCE.md` (`3f1235c`) is the standing plan.

**TRACK GWTWO COMPLETE (`21db25b`, `93ddac7`, `c3a2f01`).** The gain image at
`GW = 1` is **135 RAMB36 / 141 tile**. ROUTE2's composed BRAM gap is measured
at **52, not 51** (`253.5 + 171 = 424.5` against 372.5). The image's aspect
ratio is worth 36 tiles and is free. Full gate on the landed tree green.

**TRACK ROUTE2 COMPLETE. STEP 2 IS ANSWERED, WITH A RETRACTION ATTACHED**
(commits through `48633e5`; write-up
`docs/debugging/2026-08-30_route2-composed-route-with-both-levers.md`).
The composed A+B+C+D **ROUTES with both levers on** (`166cbd4`), and then the
controls came home: the `CB_STYLE=regs` control routes too (`5b10182`), the
second uncontrolled variable was the PBLOCK, and **"the levers made it route"
is withdrawn** (`53d4619`); the double control reproduces the killed
configuration to four exact columns (`48633e5`). What stands, all MEASURED:
lever C buys **fit and timing**, not routability; the routed design is now
**DSP-bound at 2,177 of 2,700 = 80.63%** of `pb_core` against LUT's 68.33%;
**BRAM 253.5 of 372.5, i.e. +119.0 headroom without the gain image and -52.0
with it.** The whole-composition route with a non-empty `NORM_W_IMAGE` has
**never been drawn by anyone** and is the next Vivado question after the
gain-store form settles.

**TRACK GAIN16: the 16 tiles are closed by 20, and the closure is being
re-verified before it lands.** Write-up
`docs/debugging/2026-08-31_gain16-closing-the-last-bram-tiles.md`. The gain
store becomes an **11-bit codebook index (99 RAMB36, MEASURED as the `sw11`
lossy probe) plus a 1,567-entry codebook built at elaboration from
`norm_w_9b.hex` itself** -- one input, no second image, no drift pair. Zero
DSP (41 at all six points) and zero WNS (+0.971 at all six). The 14-bit
alternative is a measured negative: 126 tiles, 9 saved, **7 short**. The
mechanism is **9 RAMB36 per bit of stored word** at three of four widths, and
splitting widths across arrays buys exactly nothing (`sw9_4_1` = 126 = `sw14`,
47% more synth time). **Do not retry either.**

**The elaboration-form decision GAIN16 left open is DECIDED by this
dispatcher: the record-free form ships.** The record form (`cbb_t`) sat in
Vivado elaboration > 15 min pinned at its 11G cap, undrawn; the record-free
form (`cb_mark`/`cb_count`/`cb_map`/`cb_rom`, four plain-array functions) is
DERIVED to produce identical constants, PASSed the 266,240-element oracle as
`cb_clean`, and is now installed in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`. The head-to-head
elaboration draw is a **documented non-goal**: the decision does not depend on
it, because the record-free form is strictly cheaper to elaborate at identical
output. GAIN16's own open item asks for the comparison before anyone *quotes
an elaboration time*; nothing here quotes one.

**Three verifications were dispatched with pre-written branches; two have
returned, one is in flight:**

- **Teeth Run B: RETURNED with exactly the required verdict.** Clean archive
  of `93ddac7` with `BASELINE_PASS=104` printed **OVERALL PASS 103 FAIL 0 and
  REGRESSION: FAIL, "BASELINE DROP: 103 passing, expected at least 104."**
  The floor is shown to discriminate, not merely to match, and the raise
  landed as `0c16b27`. Run A (floor 103, same archive) had already PASSed
  with "matches the recorded floor". The landing is complete: `c094867`,
  `a433bab`, `197e813`, `45cd94e` (ROUTE3's generator option), `0c16b27`.
- **Oracle on the installed file: RETURNED, and the swap is verified.**
  `GAIN16_ORACLE_ROW cbland mutant=none verdict=PASS rc=0 compared=266240
  mismatched=0 never_written=0 wrong_nidx=0`.
- **`cbland`: RETURNED, and the `sw11` probe did not mislead.** The shipping
  record-free file measures **RAMB36 99, RAMB18 12, tile 105, DSP 41, LUT
  5,155, FF 2,351, WNS +0.971 (248.2 MHz), synth 334 s, peak RSS 13.62 GiB
  under a 14G cap** (an honest peak, under its cap). Elaboration completed in
  minutes, where the record form sat > 15 min at its cap undrawn -- the swap
  is the fix, not merely a workaround. **Margin: 253.5 + 99 = 352.5 against
  372.5, i.e. +20.0, MEASURED on the shipping design, not on the probe.**
  Landed as `c094867` (RTL), `a433bab` (four closure repairs), `197e813`
  (write-up and artefacts).

**TRACK ROUTE3 is in flight on the workstation lane, run by the dispatcher in
session (no subagents for RTL tracks).** The question: does the composed
A+B+C+D route with a NON-EMPTY `NORM_W_IMAGE`? Every composed draw before
this one carried the synthetic ramp, so the composed BRAM figure never
included the gain store. The mirror is ROUTE2's accepted configuration
exactly (`C4_PBLOCK=1` in `pb_core`, CB_STYLE=distributed, HEAD's `gvr`
extraction) plus one changed variable: the real 266,240-line image, md5
`69f614a1515e1160f5dc9e8a9e72fdc3`, baked in by `45cd94e`. Tree `bebd952`.

**Pre-registered branches, so the answer only has to be classified:**

- **Routes, 0 nets with routing errors, 0 DRC errors.** The composition fits
  WITH the gain store. The fit question is fully closed and STEP 3 (the card
  top, row N3) is the whole remaining critical path.
- **Routes but WNS negative.** Routability holds; timing is a separate lever
  hunt. Named suspect from LEVERC48 CORRECTION 2: `CB_BCAST` (WNS reverses
  with lane count, -0.269 at 1,536).
- **Does not route.** The deliverable becomes WHERE: congestion by region,
  which nets, and whether ROUTE2's DSP-saturated windows moved.
- **BRAM over 372.5 in `pb_core`.** The OOC +20 margin did not survive
  composition; the no-sharing assumption between separately-measured units
  breaks. Report the measured deficit.
- **Elaboration time explodes at composed scale.** The record-form hang was
  OOC, the record-free form elaborated in minutes at OOC; if the composed
  synth sits in elaboration anyway, that IS the result and it is reported.

**TRACK ROUTE3 COMPLETE (`8eaaf18`). Branch 2 fires: routes but WNS
negative.** `nets=3,526,125 errors=0 unrouted=0 partial=0`;
**BRAM 351.5 against 372.5 in `pb_core` = +21.0 headroom** -- the OOC +20
margin survives composition, one tile better than the paper sum. DSP unmoved
at 2,177; LUT +109, FF +344 against ROUTE2's ramp. **WNS -0.815 against
-0.575, failing endpoints 9,056 -> 25,860, TNS -876 -> -7,437, hold clean.**
The 200-path census on the routed checkpoint puts **162 in `matvec_core`,
28 in the attention array, and ZERO in `d_norm`**: the gain codebook is no
critical path; the regression lands on the lever-C / `CB_BCAST` family
LEVERC48 already named. **The fit question is closed with the gain store
in.** The timing lever hunt is its own track and its quarry is unchanged.
Write-up: `docs/debugging/2026-08-31_route3-composed-route-with-the-gain-image.md`.

**The final-tree gate is GREEN.** Clean archive of `bebd952` (codebook,
closure repairs, generator option, floor raise, this board entry):
`OVERALL PASS 103 FAIL 0, baseline: 103 passing, matches the recorded floor
of 103, REGRESSION: PASS` (`llama-finalgate.service`, log at
/mnt/storage/llama-finalgate/gate.log).

**Operational notes for the next session.**

- **`hw/design_mv_generated.tcl` is dirty in the working tree and that is NOT
  this project's business.** The hunk sets `FIFO_DEPTH 2048, MAXOUT 8` on the
  AXU3EG `mv` block design (the OLD board, Zynq MPSoC era); mtime 2026-08-23,
  predating the overnight session. Provenance is Oren's own AXU3EG
  experimentation. It is deliberately left uncommitted and unreverted: do not
  sweep it into anything, and do not "clean" it without asking Oren.

- **`systemd-run --user --scope` attaches the scope's lifetime to the
  CLIENT.** Killing the client kills the scope. This is what killed teeth Run
  B twice (the overnight session's `borip14fp`, and once more under the new
  dispatcher). For detached jobs use transient **services**
  (`systemd-run --user --unit=...` without `--scope`), which return
  immediately and survive the launcher.
- The card was rebooted and reloaded with `fk33_pcieep_eng.bit` by Oren on
  2026-08-30 ~14:17 MDT and holds the verified striped image.
- Oren's standing instruction remains **two agents, one per Vivado lane**.
- **The gate-floor teeth for the 103 raise is only half proven** (Run A
  matched; Run B was killed mid-run) until the service above returns.
- GAIN16 found **eight dead hand-maintained source closures** across four
  tracks, two of them via a one-second textual invariant
  (`hw/fk33/results/gain16_2026-08-30/closure_audit.py`). The four fixes are
  part of the uncommitted landing. The generalisation, measured 8 for 8:
  **copying a list rotted; borrowing one did not.**

### 2026-09-02, in session, no subagents: STEP 3 is three increments in and the card top is token-identical to the oracle

**Oren's ruling stands: NO subagents for RTL work**, and none were used. The
two Claude subagents that were running died on the weekly rate limit; the
DeepSeek harness's own subagents produced a 5,363-line card-top draft that
was quarantined unreviewed and has now been DELETED.

**STEP 2 is closed and the fit question with it.** TRACK ROUTE3 (`8eaaf18`,
by the harness) routed the composed A+B+C+D **with the real gain image in**:
`nets=3,526,125 errors=0 unrouted=0`, BRAM **351.5 of 372.5 in `pb_core`,
+21.0 headroom**, DSP unmoved at 2,177, WNS **-0.815**. The 200-path census
puts 162 paths in `matvec_core`, 28 in the attention array and **zero in
`d_norm`**, so the gain codebook is not a critical path and the timing
regression belongs to the lever-C / `CB_BCAST` family LEVERC48 already named.
**Fit is answered; timing is the separate lever hunt it always was.**

**STEP 3, increments 1 to 3a, all landed in session:**

| increment | file | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `rtl/region_mem.vhd` | 6 mutations, **5 bite**, `F` does not and cannot |
| 2 | `rtl/a_desc_adapter.vhd` | 2,184 checks, **9 mutations, 9 bite** |
| 3a | `tools/gen_cardtop.py` | **token-identical to `llama_top`** |

**THE HEADLINE: `R_X(0) = -12739 hash(R_X) = 38863` from BOTH `llama_top` and
the generated card top**, same bench, same generics. MEASURED separately, one
run each.

**D1 was CORRECTED, not overturned** (`2aac831`): the card top is still a
separate file and `llama_top` is still the untouched oracle, but the fork is
GENERATED. `llama_top` is 5,684 lines and the card's decisions touch about
**8.6%** of it, so hand-copying the other 91% is a transcription task with a
defect rate -- which is exactly what the quarantined 5,363-line draft was.

**Three findings that only composition could produce, and the third is the
important one:**

1. **`region_mem` dropped a 7-bit mask.** `llama_top` indexes the group ports
   as `v_reg_a(6 downto 0)`; `region_mem` takes `unsigned(7 downto 0)` and
   never masks. `NREGION` is 14 so bit 7 is never set in normal traffic --
   **which is why `region_mem` passed its own bench with 5 of 6 mutations
   biting and was still not a drop-in replacement.** Its bench drives its own
   ports and cannot see what `llama_top` does to those signals first.
2. **`llama_top.vhd:1301` documents the wrong memory semantics.** It says
   `write-first, so an in-place overtake is visible`; `mem` is a SIGNAL, so
   reads see pre-write data and the overtake is exactly what is NOT visible.
   `region_mem` matches the CODE. **Recorded, deliberately NOT fixed:** a
   one-word edit to the oracle during a fork makes a token-identity result
   unattributable.
3. **The identity bench's own PASS was NOT an identity result.** It reports
   `R_X` bit-identical **across descriptor-latency points**, which is
   SELF-consistency and is satisfied by a consistently-wrong card top. The
   generator now injects a pin against the landmark `llama_top` itself
   produces, read from `sim/cardtop_ident_expect.txt`, and with that file
   absent it injects an unconditional FAILURE so an unpinned bench cannot
   report success.

**The gate row `sim:cardtop` is the point of the generator, not an extra.**
It runs `gen_cardtop.py --check --bench`, regenerating and diffing, and sits
beside `sim:ipsync` which exists for the identical drift on `ip_repo/*/src`.
Teeth-checked four ways: clean tree OK; hand-edited output STALE; upstream
moved STALE; **anchor vanished, rc 2, ABORTS naming the anchor**. That last
is `ooc_normadapt_extract.py`'s recorded failure mode.

**Floor: `BASELINE_PASS` 99 -> 103 (`0c16b27`, harness) -> 105 (`fcee6df`).**
Both measured on `git archive`, never the working tree, which carries
untracked `sim/tb_*.vhd` the gate auto-discovers; GWTWO's `PASS 111` was real
and unreachable. Increment 3a adds two more rows and the floor must be
re-measured, not incremented.

**NEXT, in order:** increment 3b, the A binding (D1/D2) and the `w_active`
gate (D4) into the generator; then item 4's bench at the REAL shape; then
STEP 4, the seam to D; then STEP 5, the token. The timing lever hunt
(-0.815 WNS, `CB_BCAST` suspect) is queued and its cheapest first move is a
placement-directive sweep on the ROUTE3 checkpoint.

### 2026-09-02 evening, in session, no subagents: the region file infers ZERO BRAM, and D3's "~34 RAMB36" was never implemented

**The fit question for the card was open and nobody had ever synthesised the
region file.** `region_mem` is now instantiated in `compose4_top --wire` with
`HOST_WINDOW => false` (the card configuration) and the wired top elaborates:
`C4_DONE elab rg`, 0 errors, 436,048 cells, 40,210 ports. The UNWIRED output
is byte-identical to the committed `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd`, verified by
regenerate-and-diff, so TRACK ROUTE3's numbers stay comparable.

**MEASURED, OOC at the real 9B shape on the BC-250: 0 RAMB36, 0 RAMB18,
0 URAM, 91,073 LUT of which 81,920 are LUTRAM.** The design note carried
"~34 RAMB36 -- cheap" as a DERIVED figure and concluded the card "fits inside
the same envelope". It is not 34 tiles, it is zero tiles and 91k LUTs, which
would have taken pb_core from 67.3% to about 90.7% LUT occupancy.

**TWO INDEPENDENT DEFECTS, and both must be fixed:**

1. **The THIRD READER blocks inference.** Each bank is read at three sites --
   the element read plus the group's `x` and `e`. Vivado's own words: with two
   readers `[Synth 8-3971] recognized as a true dual port RAM template`; with
   three, `[Synth 8-6849] Infeasible attribute ram_style = "block"` on all
   fourteen banks and a LUTRAM fallback. A TDP BRAM has two ports.
2. **The per-region sizing was never implemented.** `bank : bank_t` is MAXW
   deep for all fourteen regions, so `R_BETA` and `R_ALPHA` (`val_heads`
   elements each) get the same 1,536-word array as an FFN bank.

**"~34 RAMB36" WAS NEVER WRONG -- IT WAS NEVER BUILT.** 9,480 words x 128 bits
is 33.7 RAMB36, exactly the note's number. It described D3's intent; the code
declares a uniform array. A DERIVED number and the RTL disagreed for two days
because nothing had ever run the tool on this file.

**THE FIX, MEASURED:**

| configuration | BRAM | LUT | LUTRAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| as committed (uniform, 3 readers) | **0** | 91,073 | 81,920 |
| sized per region, 3 readers (R8) | **0** | 84,839 | 76,800 |
| uniform, 2 readers (R6) | 224 | 2,913 | 0 |
| **sized + 2 readers (R9)** | **100** | **2,918** | **0** |

R8 proves the two defects are independent. **R9 is the target: 100 tiles
against 224.5 spare, and 91,073 LUTs returned.**

**METHOD, and this is the reusable part.** EIGHT probes that ADDED features to
a working control (three read ports, byte-enable write, bank-in-generate,
separate write process, guarded read, and the byte-enable/multi-read
combinations) ALL INFERRED BRAM and found nothing -- a search that adds to a
passing control can only ever exonerate. DELETING from the failing file found
it in three runs, because a bisection needs an endpoint that fails. And the
tool control should have been probe ONE, not probe FIVE: four `region_mem`
variants were synthesised on the untested assumption that Vivado would infer
BRAM here at all.

Full account, twelve rejected hypotheses under "do not retry", the measurement
traps, and my own 47%-wrong tile estimate:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-02_region-mem-zero-bram.md`.

**CORRECTION to the cardtop design note 3.5.** It reads ROUTE3 as "BRAM
351.5/372.5", +21.0 spare. `pbutil_c3img_routed.rpt` says
`Block RAM Tile | 351.5 | ... | 576 | 61.02`, so the pblock holds **576**
tiles and **224.5** are spare. Where 372.5 came from is not established.

**RESOLVED THE SAME EVENING (`1da4a71`, `ca99235`). THE REGION FILE IS BRAM
AND THE FIT QUESTION IS CLOSED:**

| | this morning | now |
|---|---|---|
| BRAM | 0 | **100 RAMB36** (224.5 spare) |
| LUT | 91,073 | **3,496** |
| LUTRAM | 81,920 | **0** |

87,577 LUTs returned. The region file would have taken pb_core from 67.3% LUT
to about 90.7%; it now leaves it roughly where ROUTE3 measured it.

**The pad contract has teeth, and design-note 11.4's PRESCRIBED FIX WAS
WRONG.** The bench it asked for was written -- element writes past every
region's size, asserting region_mem's contract and not llama_top's -- and `F`
STILL SURVIVED. The reason is an OBSERVABILITY limit 11.4 missed: the write
guard and the read guard are REDUNDANT, so with a MAXW-deep array no stimulus
alone can discriminate `F`. What made it bite was the SIZING: with `bank`
declared `0 to NW-1` an unguarded pad write is an out-of-bounds index. `F` and
`G` went from "does not bite" to KILLED; `G` needed its own stimulus because
the two writers have SEPARATE guards.

**The group-read merge is NOT the merge that broke the hold contract**, and
the difference is measured: mutant `J` reproduces the old merge and the bench
still KILLS it on `el_rdata`. `x` and `e` are both gated by `r_en` alone so
they always update together; the element read fires on `el_ren` and stays
separate.

**PREVIOUSLY NOT LANDED, now landed:** the `region_mem` fix itself. Per-region sizing
makes an out-of-range write a real hazard rather than a theoretical one, and
the pad contract is still UNVERIFIED (mutations F, G and F+G all fail to bite
because the bench never drives an out-of-size access). Getting to two readers
means merging `x`/`e`, which `region_mem.vhd:286-293` records as having BROKEN
the hold contract once already. Both need bench work first.

**NEXT:** close the pad-contract gap in `sim/tb_region_mem.vhd`, then land
sizing; then the `x`/`e` merge through a registered SIGNAL (not the variable
form, which infers no BRAM) re-earned against the bench; then re-measure; then
the B/C data movers; then P&R of the wired top.

### 2026-09-02 late afternoon, in session, no subagents: the B/C seam landed and found a shipped bug in the A seam

**`rtl/u_seam.vhd` (130 lines) is the D-to-unit control seam, and it serves
BOTH B and C.** They are nearly the same shape and the differences are exactly
what it is parameterised over, read off the RTL rather than assumed: B's `done`
is a one-cycle PULSE with THREE error bits (`gdn_block.vhd:625,162-164`), C's is
a LEVEL held until its own `done_ack` with ONE `err` (`attn_block.vhd:1799`).
The seam latches `done`, emits `unit_ack`, and takes a single `unit_err` that
the glue reduces. Both are instantiated in `gen_compose4_top.py --wire`, on
slots `U_B` and `U_C`; only `U_V` and slot 3 remain tied NOT ready.

**IT FOUND AN EPOCH BUG THAT HAD ALREADY SHIPPED IN `rtl/a_desc_adapter.vhd`
(`3a145fd`), BEHIND A BENCH REPORTING 2,496 CHECKS AND 0 MISMATCHES.** Both it
and the first draft of the seam latched `job_epoch` at the issue edge.
`seq_desc_fetch` bumps `epoch_r` ON that edge (`:790`) and compares the echo
against the bumped value at `S_COMPLETE` (`:834`), so **every completion would
have been rejected as stale on the card**. `llama_top`'s seven adapters all
latch on `job_issue` instead, and `llama_top:3047` says so in as many words:
"Latch at job_issue. NOT at u_start". The rule existed and was lost by writing
against a port list rather than against the working code.

**The adapter's bench returned PASS for the bug AND PASS for the fix**, because
it held `job_epoch` constant across each job, so the two latch timings read the
same value and no timing error could be expressed. Both files are fixed and
both benches now kill it: 312 mismatches of 2,496, and 200 of 200.

**Two checks were true, correctly computed, and UNREACHABLE.** A generated
epoch counter SURVIVED (D's `epoch_r` is global across five units; the bench
only ever issued to one, so a per-job counter stayed in lockstep), and the error
latch SURVIVED (no job in the stimulus ever reported an error). Foreign epoch
bumps and an error stimulus were added; both mutants now die, and the bench
REFUSES to pass a run where either stimulus count is zero.

Full account, 10 mutations, 5 attribution controls, and the mutations that did
NOT bite under their own names:
`docs/debugging/2026-09-02_epoch-latch-off-by-one.md`.

**`compose4_top --wire` NOW ELABORATES: `C4_DONE elab seam6`, 0 errors,
429,938 cells, 39,700 ports.** It never had before. Three integration defects
that no unit bench could structurally see, all found by pushing it through
Vivado:

1. `NUNIT` and `EPOCH_W` were undeclared. `NUNIT` now comes from
   `llama_map_pkg`; `EPOCH_W` is LIFTED from `seq_desc_fetch`'s own generic
   default, with an abort if D ever stops declaring it.
2. Instance label `u_a` hid the constant `U_A` -- VHDL identifiers are
   case-insensitive. Labels are now `seam_a`/`seam_b`/`seam_c`.
3. `LITE_AW => 8` against the engine's 12-bit `s_axi_awaddr`. **The adapter's
   own bench cannot see this**: it drives a slave model of the adapter's chosen
   width, so it agrees with the adapter and not with the engine. `LITE_AW` is
   now lifted from the engine's parsed port.

**SCOPE CORRECTION, and it is the important line here.** `gdn_block` and
`attn_block` have NO region-facing ports. `llama_top`'s per-unit blocks are
DATA MOVERS, not handshake converters, and they are large: `ga_real` 353 lines,
`gb_real` 635, `gcr` 942 (measured by generate label). So `u_seam` covers the
CONTROL contract -- the part that is shared, the part D enforces, and the part
where the epoch defect lived in both files -- and roughly **1,600 lines of
per-unit data movement remain for B and C alone**. "Add seams for B, C and V"
understated the wiring work.

**`a_job_index` is a top-level PORT, deliberately not wired.** The obvious
source, D's `job_ordinal`, is wrong twice: it is 8 bits so it cannot address the
311 A jobs at all, and `llama_top` uses it as `wsyn(r, c, j_ord)`, a synthetic
weight selector in the simulation model. Wiring it would have elaborated
cleanly and produced wrong descriptors on the card. Nothing in the RTL decides
this yet, so the decision stays visible.

**A RELATED HAZARD, NOT YET A BUG:** `a_desc_adapter` also latches `u_index` at
the `u_start` edge. `llama_top:3047` says every `job_*` field still decodes the
PREVIOUS bank there, not only the epoch. It is safe today only because
`u_index` is a top-level input and is not sourced from D's decode. A warning is
now at that latch.

**NEXT, in order:** the region file into the wired top (`region_mem` with
`HOST_WINDOW=false`) and the B/C data movement; the descriptor-index decision;
then P&R of the WIRED top, whose numbers do NOT carry over from ROUTE3; then
the token check against `ref/run9b --acts bfp`. The composed bench that drives
the REAL `seq_desc_fetch` through the real seams into the real units does not
exist, so the seam is currently verified against a MIRROR of D, not against D.

### 2026-08-30 late morning, dispatcher: two lanes, both full, and the budget written down first

**Oren's standing instruction for this stretch: TWO agents, not four.** One per
Vivado lane. The REFILL RULE's "four concurrent tracks" is a target for keeping
the backlog moving, not a licence to exceed the machine, and it is explicitly
overridden here.

**THE BUDGET, stated before dispatch rather than after, because that is the
whole point of the rule:**

| resident / expected | GiB |
|---|---:|
| `llama-server`, permanent | 18.0 |
| box total | 31.0 |
| **available to this project** | **~13.0** |
| TRACK ROUTE2, composed `route_design` -- MEASURED leaving `free physical = 233 MB` while ALONE | 17.3 alloc / 11.9 RSS |
| TRACK GWTWO, on the BC-250, not on this box | 0 here |
| **left on the workstation for anything else** | **~1** |

**So the workstation is FULL with one job, and that job is ROUTE2.** The gate
itself is only 2.13 GiB (GATEGREEN, MEASURED, and it retires the 20.9 GiB figure
this dispatcher quoted all night), **but 17.3 + 2.13 against 13 is exactly the
arithmetic that hung the box on 2026-08-30.** The `BASELINE_PASS` correction
below is therefore DEFERRED, not forgotten: it requires measuring the floor,
measuring the floor requires running the gate, and the gate does not fit beside
a composed route. It runs when ROUTE2's lane frees.

**TRACK ROUTE2 dispatched, workstation lane, STEP 2 of `docs/PLAN_TO_FIRST_INFERENCE.md`.**
The question is the one everything downstream is waiting on: **does the composed
A+B+C+D design ROUTE with both levers on?** Both levers are landed and measured
at the real geometry (`47c9d9c`, `a4828ab`); **nobody has put them together and
asked the router.** Until that verdict exists, every schedule below is
unfalsifiable.

**The complication found at dispatch time, which changes what STEP 2 IS:
`compose4_top` picks up NEITHER lever automatically.**

- Its `a_eng` reaches `matvec_int4_desc_axi`, which after LEVERC48 **defaults
  `CB_STYLE` to `"regs"`.** Drawing it unchanged silently draws the un-levered
  design and would have looked like a clean negative result.
- Its `d_norm` is `ooc_normadapt`, **GENERATED by `sim/ooc_normadapt_extract.py`
  from `llama_top`'s norm region -- and RMSWIRE reports that extractor now
  ABORTS against HEAD** (`--shift` finds no `xw`; the flat ports it extracted are
  gone). **A `compose4_top` whose `d_norm` is a stale extraction of a design that
  no longer exists is not a measurement of anything.**

So ROUTE2 owns fixing the extractor (or instantiating the real thing, its call,
stated either way) and forwarding `CB_STYLE` through the generator
`hw/fk33/gen_compose4_top.py` -- **never the generated output** -- before it can
place or route.

**Pre-written branches, so the answer only has to be classified:**

- **Routes, 0 nets with routing errors, WNS reported.** STEP 2 closes; the
  workstation lane goes to STEP 3, the card top (N3), and the BRAM sum becomes
  the only open fit question.
- **Routes but WNS is negative.** Still closes the existence question, which is
  the valuable half. Timing is a separate lever hunt and `CB_BCAST` is now the
  named suspect (LEVERC48 CORRECTION 2: WNS **reverses** with lane count,
  -0.269 at 1,536).
- **Does not route.** The deliverable becomes WHERE: congestion by region, which
  nets, whether it is still net-dominated, and whether the 33,767 failing
  endpoints moved. **"It still does not route" without that is barely a result.**
- **Does not route AND the endpoints barely moved.** Then the two levers were
  the wrong axis and the pblock squeeze that PLACED at 85.4% of the die (paying
  0.602 ns) becomes the live path rather than the fallback.

**TRACK GWTWO continues on the BC-250**, drawing the `GW` curve for the norm gain
image. **BRAM is short by 51 tiles** (composed 246.5 + `gvr` 177 = 423.5 against
372.5 inside `pb_core`), and **45 of the 51 are the gain image.** Its constraint,
carried into the brief: the load-rate margin **is** `GW`, so `GW=1` leaves no
margin against a race RMSWIRE proved is invisible for **1,030 cycles, [977,
2006]** -- not the 116-cycle window this dispatcher asserted and RMSWIRE
corrected.

ROUTE2 draws with `compose4`'s long-standing **empty**-gain-image convention
(`NORM_W_IMAGE = ""`), so its BRAM total does **not** include the gain table.
**The two tracks are therefore measuring complementary halves of the same fit
question and must not be added carelessly.** If ROUTE2 routes on LUT but the
BRAM sum cannot fit, that is GWTWO's problem, and it is already dispatched
against it.

### 2026-08-30 08:30, added by the dispatcher: three landings and one new constraint

**TRACK RESETLAND landed (`8b7eefe`).** All three of RESETGUARD's orphaned
changes are in, plus a third file the brief did not know about. Generated
artefacts MEASURED byte-identical over 676 tracked files. The reset-topology
guard now has teeth with the attribution control run on every row: **7 dangerous
rows all abort, and `GUARD OFF` is `PASS` on every one**, so the new check earns
all seven kills alone rather than inheriting them. Two rows corrected the agent
rather than the guard, and are recorded as such. Remaining hole, stated as
fail-OPEN: the guard reads the block design and **cannot see the RTL**, so a
soft-reset bit added inside `fk33_engine.vhd` or `llama_top.vhd` leaves it green.

**TRACK RMSMUX draw 1 is in, on the BC-250, and every pre-registered falsifier
held.** This is the largest area lever measured on this project so far:

| quantity | predicted | MEASURED `mem_d1` |
|---|---|---:|
| `ARG` census root (the x and w reads) | -- | **443**, from **17,916** in the flat unit |
| CLB LUT | 4,798..7,823 | **4,825** |
| MUXF7 / MUXF8 | 0 / 0 | **0 / 0** |
| CLB FF | below 1,700 | **1,629** |
| DSP | 40 | **40** |
| WNS @ 5.0 ns | not predicted | **+0.971**, 248.2 MHz |

**FINAL, all three draws in, TRACK RMSMUX complete** (`5152e91`, artefacts
`hw/fk33/results/rmsmux_2026-08-30/`). Against its own same-session control,
same flow, one tool at a time:

| | `rmsnorm_rs` control | `rmsnorm_rs_mem` | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CLB LUT | 40,934 | **4,825** | **-36,109, -88.2%** |
| CLB FF | 67,196 | **1,629** | **-65,567, -97.6%** |
| MUXF7 | 17,408 | **0** | **-17,408, -100%** |
| MUXF8 | 8,704 | **0** | **-8,704, -100%** |
| BRAM tile | 0 | 6 | +6 of 425.5 free |
| DSP | 40 | 40 | 0 |
| WNS @ 5.0 ns | +1.675 | +0.971 | -0.704 ns, still meets 200 MHz |

**Scatter is `1.0000x`: the two identical-command draws are byte-identical in
every CSV field AND their censuses hash the same** (`2c85f5c4...`), agreeing
down to per-root primitive tallies. **Operationally, and this is the part the
fit table needs: SCATTER's 1.55x must NOT be applied to this 4,825.** The
pre-registered hypothesis (that SCATTER's spread came from register merging on
a foldable constant ROM, and a memory-backed unit has no fold to perform) is
**unrefuted, not proven** -- two draws, one box, one session.

The control's own census settles the attribution **on the shipped file**, not on
a transform of a superseded one: `ARG` 17,916 + `sq` 17,474 = **86.5% of the
shipped unit's LUT and 100.0% of its MUXF7 and MUXF8**, both agreeing with
LUTDIET's census to the LUT. The saving exceeds the 35,390 of read mux because
the memory form also removes `gow.o` (WRITEDEC's write decode, 2,356).

**Still open and NOT derivable from the above: the COMPOSED number.** Nothing
here is placed, routed or composed, and TIMING's composed baseline was drawn
with a foldable `w_mant`.

The 1024:1 read mux is gone, measured rather than argued: **no root anywhere
carries a single MUXF7 or MUXF8, and there is no `sq` root at all.** The FF
figure is the one worth pausing on, because it was a mechanism-level prediction
and not a curve fit: three dropped registers, `o_we` + `o_wa` + `o_wd` = 75
flops predicted, **71 measured**. Two independently derived transforms of the
same file agree root for root to the LUT on everything except the one thing that
differs between them. Scatter conclusion is held until `mem_d2` returns, as
pre-registered.

**NEW CONSTRAINT, found by TRACK NORMURAM, and it changes a composition
everyone assumed was free.** Section 12 of the RMSMUX write-up reads NORMURAM's
gain-loader word stream as free to reuse against `rmsnorm_rs_mem`'s bank port.
**It is free in ORDER and in GRANULARITY but NOT in RATE.**

- Today: budget to `r_go` is `NN+4`, load is `NN/GW+1`, margin **GW = 4.0x and
  independent of shape**. A bench at hidden 64 exercises the ratio a build at
  4096 has.
- Composed: `w_we`/`w_waddr`/`w_wdata` is one 16-bit word per cycle, so the load
  becomes `NN+2` and the margin becomes about **`1 + 1/LANES`**: 1.26x at the
  shipping `NORM_LANES = 4`, **1.07x at `NORM_LANES = 16`**, which
  `rmsnorm_rs_mem`'s own sweep covers as legal.

DERIVED by NORMURAM, reviewed for shape by the dispatcher, **not independently
re-derived**. The conclusion does not turn on the exact `S_RAW` arrival term:
any margin that depends on `LANES` has already lost the property that made the
current form checkable.

Second and worse for checking: the reader walks LANES elements per cycle against
the writer's one, both ascending, so "fully resident before use" stops being a
phase separation and becomes a race. **The deadline moves from `r_go`, which
`gvr` can see and `wbusy` checks today, to the unit's internal `S_RAW`, which
`gvr` cannot see at all.** NORMURAM's U6/U6x pair is direct evidence that this
fault class leaves the values correct and every landmark unmoved.

**Ruling: the composition is sequenced AFTER NORMURAM's six points land, and the
`nw_empty` = 49,654 anchor is not retired** -- NORMADAPT, NWROM, NWFIX and
NORMURAM all quote it as the scale their numbers sit on.

**General rule extracted, and it is reusable past this track: a change that
removes a check and tightens the margin that check was guarding is not a wiring
change.** NORMURAM was dispatched to compose two levers, judged it a redesign,
stopped, and reported. That was correct.

### The single most important thing on the board

**The composed A+B+C+D does not route on this part as currently written, and
Vivado said so itself, unprompted:**

```
[Route 35-447] Congestion is preventing the router from routing all nets.
iteration 0  494,506 -> 150,615 -> 65,271 -> 35,976 -> 23,310 -> 16,757  (56m35s)
iteration 1  69,858 -> 183,525 -> 111,513   (RISING -- the router is thrashing)
```

Placed occupancy **54,866 of 54,960 CLB = 99.83%**, congestion level 7, 33,767
failing endpoints after placement, **20,000 of the 20,000 worst net-dominated**
(mean net 4.575 ns against mean logic 0.670 ns). The route was killed as a
decision, not a completion (`ac35293`); `c4dev_physopt.dcp` is kept.

### TRACK LEVERC48 COMPLETE (`a4828ab`). STEP 1c IS DONE.

MEASURED at ROWS_IF=48 (1,536 lanes), OOC synth of `matvec_core`, same-session
`v_regs` vs `v_dist`, against HEAD's exact file (md5 verified with `git show`):

```
CLB LUT       121,139 -> 78,506    -42,633
LUT as memory   1,126 -> 13,414    +12,288 = 8.000/lane EXACT
MUXF7          24,583 -> 0         -24,583
MUXF8          12,288 -> 0         -12,288 = 8.000/lane EXACT
CLB FF         60,268 -> 73,463    +13,195  (DERIVED +13,200, residual -5)
WNS @ 3.3 ns   +0.242 -> -0.027
```

**BOTH PROJECTIONS WERE WRONG AND THE RANGE DID NOT CONTAIN THE ANSWER.** See
CLAUDE.md `09f59ac`: a constant per-lane figure, from the same three points,
predicts 42,428 against 42,633 (0.48%), while both fits missed by 8.6% and 14.9%
and their average was worse than either.

**CORRECTION 1, and it is the one that mattered: `matvec_core.vhd` has carried
the lever C implementation since `845ea28`. The real gap was that NOTHING COULD
SELECT IT** -- no wrapper declared or forwarded `CB_STYLE`, so the lever was
**implemented and unreachable from any build.** Now forwarded through
`matvec_int4`, `matvec_int4_desc_axi` and `matvec_int4_axi`, defaulting to
`"regs"`. **Proven in SYNTHESIS, a mechanism CBINFER never tested:** with
`CB_STYLE` on the `synth_design` line, `cb_reg*` goes 6,144 FF / 0 RAM to
0 FF / 26,112 RAM, saving 45,768 LUT there.

**CORRECTION 2: WNS REVERSES with lane count.** CBINFER's "marginally better at
all three geometries" is true and **does not extrapolate**: +0.116 at 768,
0.000 at 1,024, **-0.269 at 1,536**. At the real 5.0 ns period the cost is
-0.029 ns with 1.18 ns margin, so not a blocker -- but it is **the first
evidence `CB_BCAST` is load-bearing rather than optional.**

**CORRECTION 3: still NOT a fit-closer.** The codebook's footprint is 54,921
LUT, not 49,152, so LEVERC's CLB bound rescales to **5,329..10,177 CLB against
an 11,534 overshoot.** Does not close it at either end, and **this is synthesis,
not placement.**

**Verification worth copying:** the `[Synth 8-7186]` trap reproduced exactly --
**101 log lines saying the RAM was not inferred, beside 1,536 `RAM32M16` rows in
the same run's mapping report.** Its own announcement guard was keyed on a
string and its **own control caught it printing `LEVER C ACTIVE` over a register
bank**; re-keyed on `CB_LANES_PER_COPY = 1`. The coherency oracle now runs at the
real 1,536 replicas (LEVERC's ran at 64) with K3a/K3b/K3c/K9a/K2b all killing.
Neutrality: the same pair drawn three times from three source md5s, **all six
runs identical in every column including WNS**.

**Open and NAMED rather than absorbed: 517 unexplained flip-flops** at the
wrapper level (+13,717 against the codebook's +13,195 closed form), and why the
per-lane curve has a minimum at 768.

**No new `tb_*.vhd`, so `BASELINE_PASS` stays 99.**

### TRACK RMSWIRE COMPLETE (`47c9d9c`). STEP 1a IS DONE, and composition found a cost no unit draw could.

| | `ctl_flat` | `mem_bank` | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CLB LUT | 67,318 | **5,265** | **-62,053, -92.2%** |
| CLB FF | 191,664 | **2,149** | **-189,515** |
| MUXF7 / MUXF8 | 26,736 / 13,296 | **0 / 0** | -100% |
| **BRAM tile** | **171** | **177** | **+6** |
| WNS @ 5.0 ns | +1.675 | +0.971 | 248.2 MHz |

**The saving is 72% LARGER than RMSMUX's standalone -36,109, and the census says
exactly why: `gvr.uw_data` -- 19,728 LUT / 9,328 MUXF7 / 4,592 MUXF8 -- is the
ADAPTER'S OWN 4096-to-1 write-back read mux, absent from every standalone draw.**
Nobody had measured it, because a unit draw structurally cannot see it. **This is
the counter-example to "compose late": composing EARLIER would have found a
62,053-LUT structure two tracks were unknowingly leaving on the table.**

**BRAM CONFIRMED BY MEASUREMENT, and the dispatcher's DERIVED figure holds:**
`246.5 + 177 = 423.5` against `372.5` available in `pb_core` -- **51 short**. The
gain image did not move (171 RAMB36 at both points). **45 of those 51 tiles are
NOT this lever.** The binding term is the gain image, and NORMURAM's `GW = 2`
fallback has still not been measured.

**`wact_chk` EARNS ZERO KILLS**, stated plainly. Kept only because `onlyWA =
K:wact` shows it discriminates and it is the sole check on the real deadline if
the gate is ever relaxed. **R1, R2 and R11 do not bite and are named** -- R1
(gate removed, survives) measures the gate at **zero cycles**.

**THREE CORRECTIONS THAT OUTLIVE THIS TRACK.**

1. **`sim/mutate_llama_top_kv.sh` needed `vec_mem` + `rmsnorm_rs_mem` added by
   hand.** Three harnesses read that hand-maintained closure, and without it
   **every row of all three, INCLUDING THE CONTROLS, was `NOBUILD`.**
   `regress.sh` computes its own closure and stayed green throughout, so **the
   gate structurally cannot catch this class.** A mutation harness whose
   controls all fail to build reports nothing and looks like it ran.
2. **`ooc_normadapt_extract.py --shift` now aborts against HEAD** (no `xw`).
   Correct behaviour, but **NORMADAPT's `na_shift` probe is no longer
   reproducible.**
3. **`nw_empty = 49,654` IS RETIRED as a cross-track control.** It was a draw of
   a configuration -- flat port, foldable constant gain -- that `llama_top` no
   longer contains. **This reverses the dispatcher's ruling this morning that it
   must not be retired**, and correctly: that ruling was right while the tree
   still held that configuration and wrong the moment this landed. Prior
   conclusions stand for their own trees; **nothing replaces it as a shared
   scale, and four tracks were quoting it.**

### TRACK RMSWIRE, in flight: the lever is wired, and there are TWO deadlines

**Landed and green.** `rmsnorm_rs_mem` is wired into `llama_top` at the real 9B
shape. All six `sim:tb_llama_top*` rows PASS, including `tb_llama_top_normw`,
the only wrapper that exercises the gain loader. **The token landmarks did not
move, so the numeric oracle is unchanged.** New gate row
`sim:tb_rmswire_loadrace` PASS at `N=4096 LANES=4`.

**THE FINDING, and it outranks the area number the track was dispatched for.
There are TWO deadlines, not one:**

- **`S_RAW` at `start+1067`** corrupts only `max_raw`.
- **`S_EMIT` at `start+2097`** corrupts every output word.
- **The strict boundary, 2007, is the INVISIBLE one.** At `start_at=1991`, 21
  elements are read from the PREVIOUS norm op's gain **and the output is
  bit-identical to the oracle.**

Both boundaries are now pinned to the cycle and predicted exactly by one
corrected model.

**A race that produces bit-identical output cannot be caught by any check that
compares values.** This is the inverse of this project's usual failure mode:
normally the structure looks right and the numbers are wrong, and here **the
numbers are right and the design is wrong.** It is exactly what TRACK NORMURAM
refused the composition over -- it said the fault class "leaves the VALUES
correct and is invisible to the landmarks" -- and RMSWIRE has now put a number
on it: **the invisible window is 116 cycles wide, 2007 to 2123.** Nobody had one.

**CORRECTION, 2026-08-30, by TRACK RMSWIRE. WITHDRAWN: the dispatcher's "116
cycles wide, 2007 to 2123". THE WINDOW IS 1,030 CYCLES AND I HAD BOTH ENDS
WRONG.** `2007` is the window's first SAFE cycle, not its start, and `2123` was
invented. MEASURED, both boundaries pinned to the cycle (`2006` corrupt / `2007`
clean, `976` corrupt / `977` clean):

```
window = [977, 2006] = 1030 cycles = exactly S_EMIT arrival - S_RAW arrival = 2097 - 1067
```

17 points swept across it with the ordinary previous-op stale gain
(`invisible_window.txt`):

```
start_at  raw_rise  stale_raw  differing verdict
977       2044      1373       0        INVISIBLE
1400      2467       809       0        INVISIBLE
1991      3058        21       0        INVISIBLE
2006      3073         1       0        INVISIBLE
```

**Up to 1,373 of 4,096 elements read from the WRONG gain vector and not one
output word moves, anywhere in the window.**

**`tb_llama_top`'s four `EXP_*` landmarks are TOKEN HASHES and pass
throughout.** Whoever builds the card top (row N3) inherits this deadline and
**cannot see it from outside the unit** without the tap.

**THE TAP NOW EXISTS.** `rtl/rmsnorm_rs_mem.vhd` gained one output, `w_active`,
high through `S_RAW` AND `S_EMIT` and low in the `S_SHIFT1`/`S_SHIFT2` gap, so
**one pin times both deadlines**: first rise is `S_RAW`, rise-after-fall is
`S_EMIT`. Every number above was measured off it. Named association throughout
means a parent may leave it unassociated.

**THE THREE MEMORY FIGURES ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, and this run is the worked
example:**

| figure | value | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| Vivado `Memory (MB): peak` | **17.3 GiB** | the tool's peak ALLOCATION; swap absorbed it |
| summed `/proc` `VmRSS` | **11.94 GiB** | sampled RESIDENT; 5.4 GiB below Vivado's, sign of the error unknown |
| cgroup `memory.peak` | **11.0015 GiB** | **THE CAP**, 1.6 MB above `MemoryHigh=11G`. Not a footprint. |

The last row reproduces CLAUDE.md's warning exactly, on a real job.

**CROSS-VALIDATION worth having: `ctl_flat` reproduced NORMURAM's `nu_u1` on
DIFFERENT hardware, every field identical** -- `lut=67318 ff=191664 bram=171
f7=26736 f8=13296 wns=1.675`, at 1,625 s against 641 s (2.53x). That is the
BC-250/workstation bit-identity property re-confirmed on a composed draw rather
than a unit one.

**Attribution, R3: `K:loadassert / K:loadassert / K:landmarks` -- the landmarks
earn that kill on their own, so NEITHER new assertion gets credit for it.**

**Correction to my brief, accepted: I sent a COMPOSED `llama_top` draw to the
14 GB BC-250** on the strength of RMSMUX's 10.58 GB peak, which was a UNIT draw.
That is the "figure from a smaller design applied to a bigger one" error, made
in the brief itself. Vivado reported a 17.1 GB peak; the box survived on swap
(MEASURED mid-run: 10 GB free, 2 of 46 GB swap, load 1.13).

**And a distinction worth keeping: Vivado's `Memory (MB): peak` is not the
cgroup's `memory.peak`.** The former is the process's own peak allocation, which
swap can absorb -- which is why 17.1 GB "fit" on a 14 GB box. Quote the cgroup
figure, and only from a run that never reached its cap.

### THE STRIPING EXPERIMENT RAN ON SILICON, 2026-08-30 14:20. 11.09x.

```
mean cycles/beat   flat 22.49   striped 2.03   speedup 11.09x
```

**The pre-registered band was 1.60 to 3.0 and the measurement is 2.03.** Neither
falsifier fired: not 10-12 (half the lanes still sharing a channel), not ~21.6
(the descriptors not being the striped ones).

| tensor | flat | striped |
|---|---:|---:|
| `blk.0.ssm_alpha.weight` | 23.45 | **2.38** |
| `blk.0.ffn_gate.weight` | 22.19 | **2.02** |
| `blk.11.attn_k.weight` | 22.38 | **2.00** |
| `blk.20.ffn_down.weight` | 21.95 | **1.72** |

**The census is printed beside every number**, so the layout and the measurement
cannot be read apart. Whole-image: flat `{(1,27): 235, ...}`, striped
`{(25,2): 249}` -- every one of the 249 tensors on 25 channels with at most 2
lanes on the busiest. G1, G2 and G2b all PASS. Both manifests pinned by sha256
in the log, because that file has moved under three tracks.

**`trips=0` before AND after all eight jobs**, with the counter cleared and
observed 0 before each. The thermal veto was discriminating rather than
saturated, because the cold power cycle reset it -- so no number here is
contaminated by THERM-255.

**STRIPEREADY's caveat against its own interest did NOT bite:** only 15 to 17 of
27 lanes read the pseudo-channel their own engine master is wired to, so ~40%
cross the HBM global switch laterally, **and 2.03 was reached anyway.** Lateral
crossing is cheaper than the estimate feared. That is now a measured fact rather
than an assumption, and it is the one genuinely new thing this run taught beyond
confirming the prediction.

Log: `/mnt/storage/stripe_experiment_2026-08-30.log`. The card is left holding
the striped image, fully verified; re-running the command is safe.

### AND THE CARD BOOTS ITSELF NOW

`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep.mcs` written to card 1's SPI flash. On the next full
power cycle the FPGA configured from flash, trained inside the ~100 ms PERST
window, and the BIOS enumerated **root port `00:1d.0`** unaided --
`06:00.0 Xilinx Corporation Device [10ee:9034]`, `LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok),
Width x4 (ok)`.

**This retires the entire rescan/reboot problem.** The port is live at every
boot from now on, and any bitstream goes in behind it with `remove -> configure
-> rescan` (`sudo hw/fk33/host/fk33_reload.sh --with-vccint`), which is the
August procedure that always worked and had simply lost its precondition.

**`00:1c.4` was the RTX 3090's slot, not the card's.** A whole deadlock theory
was built on that misidentification this morning; it was settled by flashing and
looking, not by more inference.

### TRACK GATEGREEN COMPLETE (`392f818`, `df0b194`). THE TREE IS GREEN.

Full both-suite run on a clean `git archive 32a7b47`, GHDL 1.0.0 mcode,
`--jobs 1`:

```
 suite sim   PASS 79   FAIL 0   NOVERDICT 0   TIMEOUT 0   BUILD-ERROR 0   NOCHECK 3
 suite tb    PASS 26   FAIL 0   NOVERDICT 0   TIMEOUT 0   BUILD-ERROR 0   NOCHECK 1
 OVERALL     PASS 105  FAIL 0   NOVERDICT 0   TIMEOUT 0   BUILD-ERROR 0   NOCHECK 4   SKIPPED 6
 REGRESSION: PASS
```

**Zero red rows, so no bisection was needed.** Every row for every file the 32
commits touched passed, including the two new auto-discovered rows.

**`BASELINE_PASS` LEFT AT 99, DELIBERATELY.** The floor run (with the documented
`MV4I_FK33_FILE=/nonexistent`) measures **101**, and the gate itself printed the
raise suggestion. But `sim/tb_a_wbase.vhd` landed in `d7a6bf7` AFTER the archive
(verified with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`), so 101 describes a commit that is
no longer HEAD and **102 would be arithmetic over a row nobody has run.** The
measurement, the recipe and the reason are written into `sim/regress.sh` so the
next track closes it with one run and no re-derivation.

**WHAT THE GATE DOES NOT COVER, and this matters because seven tracks quoted
area and timing numbers today:** GHDL simulation plus seven Python/Tcl
self-checks. **No synthesis, no timing, no placement, no routing, no area, no
power, no card.** Six `*_cmp` rows are skipped by design, so **the netlist is
never compared to the behavioural model.** Four rows are NOCHECK. **Five `rtl/`
files are reached by no testbench at all.**

And the line worth keeping: **`FAIL 0` means no row noticed anything, not that
the rows would notice.** ATTNTEETH found `tb_attn_block` passing a broken tree
on a degenerate oracle, and BASEFAB's control denies its own new row credit for
seven of eight kills. **Much of this suite's apparent discrimination is
incidental.**

**TWO CORRECTIONS TO MY BRIEF.**
1. "Nobody has run the full gate" was wrong -- TRACK STRAYROW ran one on a clean
   archive of `2217778` (`912ada7`). **The practice was followed; only the
   number was stale.**
2. **THE MEMORY WARNING DOES NOT SURVIVE MEASUREMENT.** The full gate at
   `--jobs 1` peaks at **2.13 GiB** (cgroup `memory.peak`, under its 8G cap so a
   real peak), beside a 7-10.6 GiB Vivado `place_design`, `MemAvailable` never
   below 19 GiB. **The 20.9 GiB `ghdl-mcode` figure belongs to something else
   and the whole dispatch budget was provisioned against it all night.** Landed
   in CLAUDE.md; **the bench that actually reaches 20.9 GiB is now an open item
   and must be pinned before that number is quoted again.**

**ITS OWN TRAP, and it is a guard passing its teeth-check on a live operator
error:** the first gate ran WITHOUT `MV4I_FK33_FILE=/nonexistent`, so four FK33
rows ran off a `.mv4i` that has sat on this box since 28 Aug, and the headline
came out **105**. **The gate refused the raise and named all four rows.** Note
the `NOT IN GIT` check was silent and correct (an archive has no `.git`); the
optional-row refusal is a separate mechanism and it is the one that fired.

**Largest unverified surface:** `rtl/llama_top.vhd` changed after `32a7b47`
(BASEFAB's `d7a6bf7`), so the six `tb_llama_top*` rows are unverified at HEAD.

### TRACK BASEFAB COMPLETE (`d7a6bf7`). THE URGENCY CLAIM WAS WRONG, AND THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

**The form claim was right; the urgency claim that drove the dispatch was
wrong.** `w_base(p) = A_MEM_BASE + step*A_JOB_STRIDE + p*A_SUB_BYTES` is a
two-parameter affine map and PACKSTRIPE's allocator assigns segments per tensor,
greedily on fill, which no closed form expresses. **But `llama_top`'s
fabrication is not on the striped path and never was.**

MEASURED by BASEFAB and **independently VERIFIED by the dispatcher**:

- `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` binds **`matvec_int4_desc_axi`**, not `matvec_int4`.
- `grep -c 'seq_' hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` = **0**.
- `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd:610-615` drives
  `w_base <= dw(DESC_BASE0 + p)` -- **27 arbitrary 40-bit addresses fetched from
  the descriptor image.**
- `tools/gen_mv4i_desc.py`'s `sub_base()` already emits striped bases from the
  v2 manifest's `pieces`.

**So striping is expressible end to end on the card TODAY, PACKSTRIPE is not
blocked by G3, and DSEAM's "on silicon every A job would read the wrong bytes"
is conditional on an integration that does not exist. G3 is a defect in the
SIMULATION top.** This materially de-risks the striping experiment.

**A REAL DEFECT FIXED, because it is reachable today: the fabricated block was
UNBOUNDED.** DERIVED at 9B, the FFN gate job needs **393,216 beats per port
against a 256-beat sub-region, short by 1,536x**. Over-capacity jobs walked into
port p+1's region and completed **`done=1, err=0`**. `llama_top` now refuses in
`S_EXP` before `start`, so zero address beats are issued.

**THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL IS THE HEADLINE AND IT DENIES CREDIT FOR SEVEN OF
EIGHT KILLS.** `sim/tb_a_wbase.vhd` kills 8 of 11; **only M9, the new guard, is
a detection the six pre-existing rows do not already make.** And those rows kill
via **recorded numeric landmarks, not address checks** -- they fire because
`wword` happens to be address-sensitive. The two `smp` rows, whose memory answers
on `addr mod A_JOB_STRIDE`, **pass every address mutation in the table.**

**M5 IS THE MOST USEFUL ROW IN THE TABLE:** a uniform one-stride shift of every
base **survives the bench and is caught only by the control**. *A checker of
relative properties can never see a base that is uniformly wrong* -- which is
G3's own shape. **Only an address-level oracle can catch a wrong base, and the
oracle is the base array.**

**THE DECISION THAT IS ACTUALLY OWNERLESS is not the base array, it is the
integration.** `docs/2026-08-28_matvec-descriptor-format.md` says "D issues, A
consumes" at :84 and "D fetching it is remaining work" at :570 -- **two mutually
exclusive integrations in one file, and nobody has chosen.** BASEFAB argues D
fetching it is the WRONG choice for a structural reason: `seq_desc_fetch`'s
descriptor address is `resize(fetch_idx & "000", 16)`, a **fixed 8-word stride**
on which its 0-DSP claim rests, and a 39-word descriptor is not addressable by
`step*8`.

**UNVERIFIED, under their own names:** M10_guard_ge and M11_port_rev **have no
control column** -- both survived the bench, but whether the pre-existing rows
catch them is unmeasured because the batch was cut short. Run M11 first;
`tb_llama_top.vhd:892`'s `sub = p` assert should catch it.

**No full gate run** -- GATEGREEN held the box and BASEFAB correctly judged a
contended run not to be evidence. **`BASELINE_PASS` needs +1 for its row**
(`sim/tb_a_wbase.vhd`); `sim/regress.sh` untouched. GATEGREEN notified.

### TRACK TRIPVETO (`729df43`). SIX consumers, THREE failure directions, and the fix deliberately NOT landed.

**Six consumers in four files, and the load-bearing column is the failure
DIRECTION, not the file:**

| # | where | verdict at `trip_cnt = 255` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fk33_run_job.py:909, 1000-1001` | **false PASS**, veto dead; `:926` prints a correct warning about exactly this and proceeds |
| 2 | `fk33_run_token.py:737-738, 748, 775-776` | **false PASS**, `t1 == t0` forever, no trip logged, no retry fires |
| 3 | `fk33_run_token.py:980-981, 1044-1045, 1352` | silent under-report |
| 4 | `therm_selftest.py:256, 294-297` | **INVERTED** -- it asserts the counter MUST move, so saturation makes it FAIL a WORKING guard |
| 5 | `fk33ctl.py:358` | silent under-report |
| 6 | `hw/fk33/tcl/aux_probe.tcl:114-116` | silent under-report, on the JTAG path |
| -- | `fk33_stripe_experiment.py:227-260` | defended (STRIPEREADY's) |

Named as NOT consumers so nobody re-checks: `fk33_run_layer.py`,
`fk33_load_weights.py`, all of `server/`, all of `tools/`.

**CORRECTION TO MY BRIEF, and it is the reusable part: my starting grep finds
THREE OF SIX.** `fk33_run_token.py` names them `t0`/`t1` and `trips0`/`trips1`,
`therm_selftest.py` uses `trips_before`/`trips_after`, and `aux_probe.tcl` is
Tcl outside the searched path. **The REGISTER name is the search key, not the
variable names.**

**THE RTL SATURATION IS CORRECT. DO NOT REBUILD.** TRIPVETO opened expecting to
recommend widening and its own measurement killed that: **wrapping trades a
permanent, detectable failure for a periodic, undetectable one**; 16 bits buys
~4.5 h at the measured 30 crossings/s and changes nothing about the failure
mode; and any fixed width saturates above some rate. The one thing worth riding
along with a future `fk33_thermal.vhd` change is a **sticky `trip_cnt_sat` bit,
one FF** -- the only thing that can close consumers 3, 5 and 6, which no host
change can reach, because clearing destroys the history they report.

**WHY THE FIX WAS NOT LANDED, and this was the right call.** Applying
STRIPEREADY's clear-and-prove shape inside `fk33_run_job.py` **BREAKS
`fk33_run_token.py`**: its retry wrapper samples `t0` immediately before
`_ORIG_RUN_JOB(...)` and `t1` immediately after, so if `run_job` clears then
`t1 < t0` on every job, `t1 != t0` fires, and **a phantom trip is logged and a
retry burned on every job of every layer of every token.** That converts a dead
veto into a live false alarm **which would read as evidence about THERM-255
itself.** The correct fix is a structured channel that `run_token` consumes
instead of sampling around the call: two files, hardware-only consumer, not
something to half-land before a reboot.

**TWO TRAPS FOUND BY READING, for whoever takes the fix:**
- `SimBar._status` at `fk33_run_job.py:774` fires the injected trip only when
  `self.trip == faults["trip0"]`. After a clear that is `0 == 255`, so the
  `trip0=255, trip_during=1` mutant **would not bite AND would look like it
  had.**
- `tests_fk33ctl.py:137` and `:175` both pin the count at **3** (DERIVED:
  `(0x8A0377CD >> 16) & 0xFF = 3`). **The existing fixture cannot see this
  defect at all.**

**Correction appended in place:** `2026-08-30_therm255-...md:262` ("nothing here
is fixed") is now stale FOR THE RTL IN THE TREE -- the capture-a-cycle-late
defect is fixed at `fk33_thermal.vhd:1146-1160`. **It remains true for the
bitstream ON THE CARD.**

**OPERATIONAL NOTE FOR THE STRIPING RUN:** `fk33_stripe_experiment.py` defends
itself, so the one-command experiment is safe. **`fk33_run_job.py` and
`fk33_run_token.py` invoked directly are NOT**, and at 255 they will report
health.

### TRACK STRIPEREADY COMPLETE (`0eac8d4`, `639880e`). THE EXPERIMENT IS ONE COMMAND.

```bash
cd /home/orencollaco/GitHub/llama.vhdl
python3 hw/fk33/host/fk33_stripe_experiment.py run
```

It pins BOTH manifests by hash, runs every offline guard, loads and verifies the
FLAT image, runs the four published jobs, repeats for the STRIPED image, and
prints one table with CYCLES, BEATS, STARVED, cycles/beat, **the trip count**
and the channel census on each row. Idempotent, both phases are full loads, and
it finishes with the card holding a verified striped image. **If it refuses it
produces no number and names the guard.**

**The `index.txt` gap is closed WITHOUT touching the packer**, which matters
because the packer has moved the manifest under three tracks now.
`tools/ref9b/make_index.py` reads geometry and shape only, never `hbm_offset`
and never `pieces`; STRIPEREADY enumerated its inputs, PREDICTED the striped
index would be byte-identical to the flat apart from line 1, then generated it:
MEASURED **428 body lines identical, one differing provenance comment**, and
`git diff --stat -- tools/pack_model_fk33.py` empty. Blocker measured shut both
ways (`index.txt does not exist` to `248320 of 248320 logits, 0 differ`).
**But `plan` is INERT to placement** -- flat vs striped differs in two lines,
both timings -- **so it closes the gap without being a striping verifier and
must not be quoted as one.**

**THE FINDING, and it sits directly on the measurement path.**
`hw/fk33/host/fk33_run_job.py`'s thermal veto rests on `trip_cnt`, which
**SATURATES at 255**. VERIFIED by the dispatcher at
`hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_thermal.vhd:1166`:

```vhdl
if trip_cnt /= to_unsigned(255, trip_cnt'length) then
  trip_cnt <= trip_cnt + 1;
end if;
```

At 255 the veto's `trip1 != trip0` test is **false forever** while still
printing `trips=255 (was 255)`. **The guard stops discriminating exactly when
the condition it guards is worst, and reports health while doing so** -- and
THERM-255, the open issue named for that number, is the reason the counter gets
there. STRIPEREADY's own runner defends itself (clear, then refuse unless the
post-clear word reads 0) and correctly flagged the rest as needing an owner.
Dispatched as TRACK TRIPVETO.

**T12 IS CLOSED**, after three tracks carried it. Honestly reported: its first
mutant was **not clean** -- it overlapped the f32 blob and `hbm_map` killed it
for the wrong reason, and **the neighbouring arms revealed that, not its own**.
The clean version is a same-size permutation that five checks pass and the
runner refuses. **Closed at the host, still open at the packer.**

**THE PREDICTION IS UNCHANGED, and its load-bearing input is now MEASURED over
all 249 tensors rather than inferred:** `striped {(25, 2): 249}` -- every
tensor, 25 channels, exactly 2 lanes on the busiest. The flat half of that
census **independently reproduces the counters document** (235/13/1, the missing
3-segment file being `token_embd`, absent from `noembd`).

**NEW FALSIFIER INPUT, and it weakens the run rather than strengthening it:**
only **15 to 17 of 27 lanes** read the channel their own master is wired to, so
the result leans hard on STRIPEPATH's lateral-crossing ESTIMATE -- and the four
measurement tensors split 17/15/17/15, **not enough spread to test it.**

**Verification:** 11 mutants x 5 arms, **control surviving in every arm**. G1
earns 1 independent kill, the census family 3, whole-image scope 1 that the
four-tensor scope cannot see, the oracle join 1. **M2, M3, M4 earn G1 nothing
and are named. M7 and M8 survive as designed. G4's extent-count cross-check
earns ZERO and is labelled.** Six commands traced with zero `/dev` opens.

**Correction to my brief, and it is right:** "verify the striped image and the
striped descriptors" is TWO guards and either can pass while the other fails --
**which is exactly the `output.weight` byte-identity case TOKENSTRIPE hit.**

### TRACK CBINFER COMPLETE (`0d24f7d`). LEVER C IS ALIVE: Vivado DOES infer LUTRAM.

LEVERC's own first open item said this "must be the first thing a Vivado lane
checks, before any area number", because a NO would have made lever C **1,536
register copies, strictly worse than today**, and moot every row containing it.

**1. YES.** MEASURED at three geometries on `xcvu33p-fsvh2104-2L-e`, Vivado
2023.2: at `CB_STYLE = "distributed"` every codebook copy becomes one
`RAM32M16` (16 x 8, 8 LUTs) and the 16:1 mux per lane vanishes. The clean line
is the object-level census at ROWS_IF=8:

```
v_regs_r8   cells named cb_reg*:  RAM=0     FF=1024
v_dist_r8   cells named cb_reg*:  RAM=4352  FF=0
```

**LEVERC's 12,288-LUTRAM assumption is now MEASURED rather than assumed:**
LUTRAM added per lane is **8.000 at all three points** (128, 256, 512 lanes),
MUXF8 removed 8.000/lane, MUXF7 removed 16.00/lane -- **matching CONGEST's
shell per-lane census exactly**.

**2. The `ram_style` attribute from a function of a generic is ACCEPTED and
EARNS NOTHING.** The Final Mapping Report attributes 128 of 128 copies to `User
Attribute` -- but the attribution control (both attributes deleted) is
**byte-identical in every column** and merely relabels the inference `Implied`.
**So LEVERC's two-sibling-architecture fallback is not required and would buy
nothing.** `dont_touch = "false"` versus deleting it is also identical, so
presence-not-value was tested and refuted.

**3. `ram_style = "registers"` does NOT change today's shipping build** --
identical on eleven columns and WNS to the last digit, with a repeat draw
reproducing itself exactly, so it is a demonstrated no-op rather than a
coincidence.

**THE TRAP THAT WOULD HAVE INVERTED ANSWER 1, and it is the mirror image of
NORMURAM's URAM trap the same morning.** Vivado's log says, one hundred times:

```
WARNING: [Synth 8-7186] Applying attribute ram_style = "distributed" is ignored,
object 'cb[0][0]' is not inferred as ram due to incorrect usage
```

**Every object it names IS a `RAM32M16` in the same run's mapping report.**
Where `[Synth 8-10226]` claimed a resource the design never got, this one denies
one the design did get. **Vivado's inference log is unreliable in BOTH
directions; only the mapping report and the primitive census are
authoritative.** Landed in CLAUDE.md as `7888ef9`.

**CORRECTION OWED TO LEVERC, and it does not change their conclusion.** A
`RAM32M16` is 8 LUTs and CLB-atomic, so LEVERC's fragmented "4 per CLB" case is
unreachable. Their CLB saving narrows to **4,608 .. 8,946** from 3,072 .. 8,946.
**Lever C still does not close the fit under either bound; LEVERC's conclusion
stands.**

**NEXT VIVADO JOB, and it must go on the WORKSTATION:** the FK33 geometry
`ROWS_IF=48` was **not drawn**. ROWS_IF=16 already peaked at **14.38 GB summed
Vivado RSS on the BC-250's 14 GB**, so 48 does not fit there. Projections to
1,536 lanes are labelled: the structural per-lane figures are exact at three
points, but the **total-LUT saving is an ESTIMATE of 36,000-39,000** because
per-lane saving falls with lane count (29.11 / 27.71 / 26.05) and two models
disagree. DERIVED and exact: **+13,200 FF** at ROWS_IF=48 (three-point model,
residuals 0, -2, +4).

**Its own trap, recorded against itself:** the first primitive-census parser
assumed a four-column Primitives table (it has three) and **silently wrote zeros
into six CSV rows beside a populated utilization table** -- the exact failure
the cross-check exists to catch. Parser now hard-errors on zero rows.

**Not covered:** OOC synthesis, not placement, and lever C's claim is about
PACKING which only a place run measures. `matvec_core` alone, not the composed
design.

### TRACK NORMURAM COMPLETE (`c479ae8`, `57ecea4`, `5026897`). The gain image is out of LUT fabric.

`rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s `gvr` generate reshapes `NW_TBL` to 4 elements per word,
lets Vivado infer BLOCK RAM, and shifts it into a plain register. The
empty-image build (`gwc`) keeps the old code **character for character**.

| point | LUT | BRAM | URAM | WNS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `nu_empty` pinned, no image | 49,654 | 0 | 0 | +1.675 |
| `nu_ec` NEW RTL, no image | **49,654** bit-identical | 0 | 0 | +1.675 |
| `nu_a` route (a), image | 83,709 | 0 | 0 | +1.675 |
| `nu_rom` pinned, image | 89,970 | 0 | 0 | +1.675 |
| `nu_u1` NEW RTL, image | **67,318** | 171 | 0 | +1.675 |
| `nu_u2` same command again | **67,318** | 171 | 0 | +1.675 |

**Saving +15,279 to +60,747 LUT, and the WHOLE INTERVAL belongs to the
before-side.** `nu_empty` reproduces NWFIX's control on all eleven columns;
`nu_u1`/`nu_u2` agree on the entire `report_utilization` with byte-identical
censuses (md5 `1b341a73`). WNS unchanged on all six points. The gain store,
address generator, shift register and busy logic together are **313 LUT and
58,453 FF**, landing within 259 LUT of NWFIX's HBM floor **and spending no HBM
bandwidth**.

**THREE CORRECTIONS THAT OUTRANK THE NUMBER.**

1. **Route (a) is a no-op, and not for the reason anyone gave.** `Synth 8-6040`
   fires word for word with `:= 0` deleted, because **a VHDL signal of subtype
   `natural range 0 to NW_N-1` has an initial value regardless** -- the language
   gives it `subtype'left`, which is 0. **There is no way to spell "no initial
   value".** The width would have refused it anyway: 65 x 65,536 needs 911
   primitives against 672 RAMB36 / 320 URAM288.
2. **URAM cannot hold this table at all** -- see the relabelling above.
3. **"+32,943" was the DROP saving.** Any real gain pays `rmsnorm_rs`'s 17,367
   LUT fold wherever it lives, so **no route that keeps the image reaches
   349,421.**

**THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL CHANGED A CLAIM IN THE NEW CHECK'S FAVOUR, which is
the rarer direction.** U6 is a margin failure that leaves the VALUES CORRECT,
killed by the new `wbusy` assertion; U6x is the same mutant with that assertion
disabled and it **survives with zero landmarks moved**. Both m7-class packing
mutants killed on all four landmarks. **U7 reported as a row that does not
bite**: the landmarks cannot see `GW`.

**NEW MEASUREMENT TRAP, landed in CLAUDE.md as `cc06f35`: a capped job's
`memory.peak` is the CAP, not the peak.** MEASURED: a five-point batch under
`MemoryHigh=13G` reported `memory.peak` **1.1 MB above 13 GiB** -- the throttle
holding it there, not the job's appetite. **The only honest unthrottled figure
was `nu_empty`'s 10.54 GiB.** Cap for safety; read `memory.peak` for size only
from a run that never reached its cap.

**Open:** nothing here is placed or routed; the Vivado half of the values oracle
is still open; and **171 BRAM is 25.45% of the device**, so a `GW = 2` point is
the obvious next measurement if BRAM binds. The `rmsnorm_rs_mem` composition is
DEFERRED, not rejected, for the rate reasons recorded above.

### TRACK ATTNTEETH COMPLETE (`5755473`,`a8053ca`,`1e18ce3`). The oracle's STIMULUS was the defect.

**`tb_attn_block` passed a deliberately broken tree, and the mechanism was never
in the bench.** Root cause is ONE LINE of the oracle's stimulus,
`ref/attn_block_vec.c:864`:

```c
for (i = 0; i < N * N_KVH; i++)    vin[i] = m12(65537 + SEED, i);
```

Uniform on [-2048, 2047] with no per-block structure, so every block's peak
lands in the top binade and `kv_quant` gives all NBLK blocks the SAME exponent.
MEASURED with a probe at the fold site: all six folds are `e0=e1=e2=e3=6`.
**`v_ref` is the minimum over that, and a minimum over a constant vector is that
constant.** P8 compared exactly the right numbers, bit-exactly, with no
tolerance, **and could not have disagreed whatever the reduction did.**

**All four hypotheses in my brief were wrong** -- shared source, narrow scope,
stale vector, early exit. Each was checked and each refuted. The defect was
upstream of every one of them.

| tag | mutation | before | after | `kv_seam` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | drop the last tree stage (TIMING's) | PASS | KILLED | KILLED |
| M2 | no reduction, return block 0 | PASS | KILLED | KILLED |
| M3 | maximum not minimum | PASS | KILLED | KILLED |
| M4 | pad with 127 | PASS | SURVIVED | SURVIVED |
| M5 | result never folded in | KILLED | KILLED | KILLED |
| M6 | per-TOKEN not per-SEQUENCE | PASS | SURVIVED | KILLED |
| M7 | defect C1, `v_ref` shared across layers | PASS | SURVIVED | KILLED |
| M8 | drop the LAST block exponent | PASS | KILLED | SURVIVED |

**1 of 8 to 5 of 8. M8 is the one that matters: it survived BOTH benches
before.**

**THE ATTRIBUTION CONTROL PAID FOR ITSELF AGAIN. P9 is credited with ZERO
kills.** All eight verdicts are identical with P9 disabled; P8 does all the
killing, and P9 is justified as a stimulus gate rather than a detector.
**Without the control this would have claimed four detections for a check that
makes none.** P9's own teeth-check (flat stimulus, honest RTL) fails with every
sub-check firing while P8 passes.

**Survivors kept and explained:** M4's pad branch is unreachable (`NBLK` is
4/4/8, all powers of two -- dead code, not a missed defect). M6 and M7 are
structural to a one-token one-layer bench and `kv_seam` owns and kills both.
**The two benches have DISJOINT blind spots**, which is a stronger statement
than either being adequate.

**AND IT CAUGHT ITS OWN FIX REINTRODUCING THE DEFECT ONE LEVEL UP.** A per-head
PERMUTATION taper gives every head the same `v_ref`, so `attn_emit`'s cross-head
fold went degenerate. **It passed the generator's assert, P9 as first written,
and the whole suite.** The sibling enumeration caught it; nothing checking the
fix did.

**HIGHEST-VALUE FOLLOW-ON, NOT YET OWNED:** `ref/attn_block_seq_vec.c:214-215`
still carries the untapered line word for word, giving `e_grid = {20,20}` on
layer 1 -- **a minimum over a constant vector on half the design**. And
`tb_attn_kv_seam`'s teeth on this structure are **ONE block exponent of sixteen
headers** (15 of 16 folds are flat `6 6 6 6`), which is the repo's entire
coverage of the fold, at a hand-picked seed. Blocked on `sim/regress.sh`
(GATEGREEN's), whose lines 1499-1518 justify that generator's SEED=2 in terms of
exactly these numbers.

### TRACK TOKENSTRIPE COMPLETE (`6ca385f`, `a25847b`). The sixth consumer, and a guard fixed rather than muted.

**Defect sized first:** 15 window descriptors, **0 errors, 405 of 405
sub-region bases wrong**. After: 405/405 MOVE, 0 wrong against the manifest,
lm-head **3 to 25 pseudo-channels**. It was THREE lines, not two -- `TailJob`
uses `__slots__`, so `pieces` had to be declared there or the assignment raises.

**THE TRAP, and it explains why a track looking straight at this missed it:**
`output.weight.mv4i` sits at `hbm_offset` **0 under BOTH layouts** (same
`blake2b_128`), so the pre-change tail's 15 descriptors are **byte-identical
between the flat and the striped manifest. Diffing the two runs shows
nothing.** Only comparison against the manifest's `pieces` sees it.

**`tools/weights_residency.py` was FIXED, not muted, and the old rule was
another coincidence-of-geometry guard.** `stack_hole_bytes` is not "the gaps":
`place()` returns `hole` only for a stack-boundary skip and the striped branch
never calls `place()`, so it is structurally 0. The old check compared it
against ALL inter-placement gaps, **and the two coincide under the flat layout
only because a bump allocator leaves no other gaps.** Replaced by a closed
ledger, DERIVED exact to the byte before any rule was written:
`2,690,994,176 = 0 + 2,422,558,720 + 268,435,456`.

**It is STRICTER on the flat layout, not looser**: the old rule compared totals,
so a `stack_holes` entry at the wrong address, a list disagreeing with its own
total, and an emptied list all passed. All three now fail and the pre-change
file survives all three. Ledger earns **10 independent kills**; rows earning
nothing (S1b, S5, S6) are named.

**Corrections issued:** STRIPEPATH's "running `fk33_run_token.py` needs the
card" is WRONG -- `plan` and `selfcheck` are offline and were traced clean, so
its section 9.2 step 4 is superseded. And my brief's framing was off: the
manifest's `stack_hole_bytes` was always correct; it was the CHECKER's
re-derivation that was flat-only, which is why the fix is a consumer change.

**Traps it hit and reported against itself:** its first teeth table credited the
change with 8 kills it had not earned, for want of a whole-ledger-removed arm.

**STILL OPEN and blocking a full striped re-run:** the striped packed dir has
**no `index.txt`** (PACKSTRIPE's artefact), so `plan`'s host re-run cannot cover
the striped set. T12 remains unclosed.

### TRACK STRIPEPATH COMPLETE, 2026-08-30 (`d7f96cd`, `9d73018`). The striping path emits.

**The defect, SIZED before it was fixed:** pre-change, `fk33_run_layer` on the
striped set emitted 296 descriptors, **0 errors, and 7,992 of 7,992 bases
wrong**. It failed silently and completely.

**After: all bases MOVE and land where the manifest placed their file offset**,
reaching **25 distinct pseudo-channels** read from address bits [32:28].
`output.weight` goes from 3 segments to **25**. Inertness on the flat set:
**24,258 descriptor words, nine diffs**, one intentional and named.

**Guards that could not see their own defect, found here:**
`check_hbm_stack` printed **PASS** with a piece straddling the 4 GiB stack line.
It now earns 7 kills with the pre-change file earning zero on every row and its
control surviving, so that attribution is clean. And **the range count was never
a discriminator at all**: 7,154 on BOTH layouts, because
`250 + 249*27 = 249*28 + 1 = 6,973`.

**Zero-kill checks named and NOT credited** (the most valuable part of the
report): the extent rule in `check_byte_cover` (its NOEXT arm kills identically
to NEW on all 13 rows), and the `pieces` threading in `gen_layer_program` and
`fk33_run_layer`. Non-biting mutants **T5 and T12** reported under their own
names, with **T12 flagged as the hole nothing here closes**.

**CORRECTION issued by STRIPEPATH, and it binds every future track on this
path:** PIECES' quoted numbers do not reproduce -- against today's manifest the
pre-PIECES world does not emit 311 jobs, it dies on an `hbm_map` OVERLAP, and
the bases are not byte-identical to the flat program's. **The defect is real and
was measured directly; the specific numbers must not be quoted. PACKSTRIPE has
now moved the manifest between tracks twice.** Pin the manifest's identity
(path plus hash) in any write-up that measures against it.

Also corrected: `fk33_run_layer` needed **no** `hbm_map.plan().check()`, because
`make_layer` already calls `place_desc_arena()` which runs one and raises. "The
same two lines" was wrong once already.

### THE CARD EXPERIMENT IS READY, AND ITS PREDICTION IS PINNED IN ADVANCE

Section 9 of `docs/debugging/2026-08-30_stripepath-five-emitters.md` carries the
offline arm, the card arm (Oren's only) and a failure-mode table.

**Prediction, stated before the run: cycles/beat should fall from the MEASURED
21.67 to between 1.60 and 3.0.** DERIVED: 27 beats on one pseudo-channel = 21.60
core cycles; at most 2 lanes per channel = 1.60, which is exactly the RTL's own
ideal-memory floor.

**The falsifiers are stated too, and this is what makes it an experiment rather
than a demonstration.** A measured **10 to 12** means half the lanes still share
a channel. An **unchanged 21.6** means the image or the descriptors are not the
striped ones, and is **NOT evidence about the theory**.

**No new bitstream is needed.** Two things still block it:

1. **`hw/fk33/host/fk33_run_token.py:1103` is a SIXTH consumer with the
   identical defect**, on the token path, emitting the lm-head's 15 window
   descriptors. **Until it lands, a striped set gives a correct 32-layer body
   and a WRONG lm-head.** Dispatched as TRACK TOKENSTRIPE.
2. **PCIe enumeration.** The card is configured (`d31ab02`) but its root port is
   hidden by the BIOS; see the CORRECTION in
   `docs/debugging/2026-08-30_restoring-the-card-after-a-power-cycle.md` -- a
   rescan cannot work and the fix is a warm reboot, deferred by Oren until the
   synthesis and gate lanes quiesce.

Also handed over: `tools/weights_residency.py` fails on a striped manifest for a
reason unrelated to what it guards (`stack_hole_bytes` computed for the flat
layout against 2.69 GiB of by-design arena gaps) -- **needs an owner BEFORE it
gets muted**, also TOKENSTRIPE. And `pack_model_fk33.expand_pieces()` remains a
**second producer** of piece extents.

### TRACK SEAMMAP COMPLETE, 2026-08-30 (`1e46fb3`). N2 option (a) has an address.

**`0xE000` is assigned, and it was checked rather than inherited.** MEASURED
against the EMITTED `build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` rather than a document: BAR
occupancy is 0x3000 SYSMON, 0x9000 GPIO, 0xA000 id, 0xB/C/D000 thermal,
0x10000 + 8K scratch, 0x12000/0x13000 engine. **`0xE000` and `0xF000` are the
only free 4 KB pages below the scratch**, and `0xE000` is the lower. It is
inside the 128 KB BAR and 4 KB aligned, which `fk33_seam`'s 12-bit
`s_axi_awaddr` requires. `FK33_SEAM_BASE_PROPOSED` is now `FK33_SEAM_BASE`
across all four callers, and **the generator refuses to emit while the
`_PROPOSED` define survives**.

**THE FINDING, AND IT IS A DESIGN DECISION THE BRIEF DID NOT ANTICIPATE. There
is no subsystem D behind this seam (N3), so its D face is driven by constants,
and the OBVIOUS tie-off hangs the host.** MEASURED at `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd:549`:
the completion arm runs only `if running = '1'`, and `running` is cleared ONLY
by `d_err`, `d_tok_done` or ABORT. **Tie both low and a GO sets `running`
forever** -- neither done nor err ever sets, and the `(done | err)` poll loop
this seam's own header prescribes never exits.

So `d_err` is tied HIGH: every GO refuses one cycle later with `EC_DESC` and
`ERR_INFO[3:0] = 0xF`, **a code `llama_top` cannot produce**, so the refusal is
distinguishable from a real error rather than merely silent. Faking a completion
via `d_tok_done <= d_go` was considered and REJECTED.

**SEAMMAP's own correction to my brief, and it is right: N2 must NOT be reported
as "done" without the clause.** What sits at `0xE000` is a real, addressable,
honest seam **with no transformer behind it**. The brief framed the
instantiation as mechanical; it was not.

**Verification worth copying.** `check_bar_map` **parses the emitted script**
rather than restating the map, deliberately avoiding the hand-table shape that
produced the descriptor-base coincidence defect. Address teeth ran a 3-arm
attribution control (pre-SEAMMAP needles / new needles / the parser): 8
refusals, 3 must-not-refuse, `MAP ALONE=4 both=4 NEITHER=0`, with **the
pre-existing arm empty on every row** (DERIVED: `git show
d53af73:hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py | grep -ci seam` = 0). `md5sum -c` over **1,868**
tracked files.

**NON-BITER, reported under its own name and it is the useful one:** relocating
`fk33_id` to `0xF000` is legal on every rule and WRONG, because `fk33_regs.h`
hardcodes `0xA000`. **The check verifies internal consistency, not agreement
with the host header.** Filed as work.

**QUEUED, NOT REFUSED: a Vivado `--bd-only` run.** SEAMMAP requested it and did
not take it, because its memory footprint is unmeasured and both lanes were
committed (NORMURAM on the workstation, CBINFER on the BC-250). **It is the only
non-hardware thing that answers whether the seam responds at `0xE000`**, and it
would settle three things that cannot be checked statically: the inferred
segment name `fk33_seam_0/s_axi/reg0`, whether module reference accepts
`fk33_seam`'s `unsigned`/`natural range` ports, and whether
`core_reset/peripheral_reset` ([0:0]) connects to the scalar `rst`. All three
fail LOUDLY at the BD stage, none silently. **Dispatch when a lane frees.**

Also open from SEAMMAP: `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd`'s `CAPS_FLAGS_V = 0x5` sets
`FK33_CAP_SAMPLER` in a bitstream with no sampler (reported to DSEAM, correctly
not fixed -- not its file); `fk33_regs.h` has no seam block and its non-thermal
bases are unpinned; `desc_ram` BRAM inference is unsynthesised.

### TRACK TIMING COMPLETE, 2026-08-30 (`9e3348e`..`5d25911`). Three results.

**1. SUBSYSTEM C CLOSES 200 MHz STANDALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME.** The 256 failing
endpoints were one structure: `c_attn/vref_r`, and `LAYERS*N_KVH*EXP_W` =
8*4*8 = **exactly 256 bits**. All forty worst placed paths ran
`vref_r_reg` to `vref_r_reg` through 28 logic levels, and the post-synthesis
report named the mechanism itself (`Logic Levels: 28 (CARRY8=8 ...)`): a SERIAL
min-fold over `NBLK`=8 seeded from `vref_r`. Reassociated into a balanced tree
with `vref_r` folded last. Min is associative, commutative and idempotent on
integers, so the change is **bit-exact and latency-neutral by construction**,
and CARRY8 is unchanged at 2,734 -- the same comparisons, re-bracketed.

MEASURED on the BC-250, before and after: **WNS -3.122 to +0.825, Fmax 123.1 to
239.5 MHz.**

**2. THE FIT, WITH RMSMUX MEASURED AND THE SQUEEZE DENSITY. The two levers are
EQUALS, correcting TIMING's own earlier claim that lever C led:**

| configuration | CLB |
|---|---:|
| RMSMUX alone | **92.1%** |
| lever C alone | **92.9%** |
| **both together** | **84.1%, the first configuration with real margin** |

**3. THE BRIEF I GAVE TIMING WAS WRONG, AND IT SAID SO.** I told it "only 256 of
1,027,089 endpoints fail". **That was the POST-SYNTHESIS count; the placed
report already on disk said 33,767.** There were two independent problems and my
brief described only the first. The other 33,511 are **net-delay, not logic**:
mean net 4.575 ns against mean logic 0.670 ns, 20,000 of 20,000 net-dominated.
The attribution control is the convincing part: **subsystem A, unchanged and
proven on silicon, fails 3,779 endpoints in this composition.** Root cause is
area, at 54,866 of 54,960 CLB.

Also retired: the post-synthesis 279,484 hold violations are an **artefact**,
collapsing to 7,881 on placement with no RTL change, and the named path has
`Logic Levels: 0`.

**NEW OPEN ISSUE, and it is the highest-value line in TIMING's report:
`tb_attn_block` PASSES A DELIBERATELY BROKEN TREE.** This is the bench named
after the unit, carrying subsystem C's bit-exact oracle, and it was found only
by running the mutant. **A guard passing for the wrong reason, in the one place
that was most trusted.** It needs an owner. Note this is the same unit that
"passed seven properties and 13 of 17 wiring mutations while computing wrong
numbers" in the CLAUDE.md verification list, so this is the SECOND time
`attn_block`'s evidence has been shown not to discriminate.

**AND THE STANDING CAUTION ON ALL THREE NUMBERS ABOVE.** Those percentages need
a density reached only under pressure, and reaching it cost **0.602 ns of WNS**
on a design whose observed failure is `[Route 35-447]` **routing congestion**,
not area. **The next question is not another area number. It is whether an 84%
configuration ROUTES.**

### SUPERSEDED 2026-08-30 by TRACK TIMING's pblock squeeze (`1ebac6e`)

**The table immediately below is SUPERSEDED. Its density constant was measured
on an empty die and is wrong under pressure.** It is kept because the levers and
their ordering are still right and because the correction is the point.

The squeeze constrained the composed design to a pblock at 85.4% of the die and
asked whether the placer would fail. **It did not fail. It placed.**

```
PS_PLACE_RC       0
PS_UTIL  lut 347906  clb 49497
PS_DENSITY        7.029 LUT per CLB
PS_WNS            -3.658
```

| | whole die free | pblock, 85.4% |
|---|---:|---:|
| CLB | 54,866 | **49,497** |
| density | 6.324 | **7.029** (+11.1%) |
| non-mux density | 5.617 | **6.553** |
| WNS | -3.056 | **-3.658** |

**Density is elastic. 6.324 was a property of an empty die, not of the
netlist** -- the same netlist packed into 5,369 fewer CLB under pressure. This
falsifies the `D_nonmux = 5.617` constant that the C4 arithmetic used. LEVERC's
mux term is untouched: 8.00 is pinned by the CLB structure, exactly as its
architectural argument requires.

| configuration | old (5.617) | **squeeze-measured (6.553)** |
|---|---:|---:|
| today + shell + ROM best | 123.5% | **110.1%** |
| **+ lever C + gain to BRAM** | 105.3% | **92.9%** |
| + lever C + BRAM + `d_norm` | 94.7% | **82.7%** |
| **+ `d_norm` + BRAM, no lever C** | 102.2% | **90.7%** |

**Two levers may suffice on CLB count. The 105.2% relayed to Oren is
superseded.**

**RELABELLED 2026-08-30 by TRACK NORMURAM: those rows said "gain to URAM" and
the resource is BRAM.** MEASURED, Vivado's own words in TRACK NWROM's log
(`/mnt/storage/nwrom/out/vivado_nw_lfura65.log:412`, sitting in the artefacts
since 2026-08-29 and never read past the result CSV):

```
WARNING: [Synth 8-10226] The ram_style = ultra set on ROM
"ooc_nwrom_memura__GCB101/gvr.nwrom" can not be honored for this device.
The URAM primitives on this device do not support initializations to any
non 0 values.  This ROM will be implemented using BRAMs
```

Both of NWROM's memory probes report **`uram=0`**. The "114 URAM288" that this
brief, TRACK SCATTER section 11 and TIMING's table all carried is the **`bram`
column of a run in which the URAM request was REFUSED and silently downgraded.**
The probe never used a single URAM.

**The LUT saving is real and unaffected; what changes is the currency.** The
gain image costs **114 to 135 BRAM tiles of the 672 on this part**, and nobody
has been charging that against a BRAM budget. RMSMUX's vectors want 6 more.
**"320 idle URAM288" is true and unusable**: URAM on this device is available
only to a store written at RUN TIME, so the only URAM-capable way to serve this
gain is the HBM route, which is a point in route (c)'s favour that no brief
made.

**No design change followed, and that is correct.** Vivado falls back to BRAM
either way; asking for `rom_style = "block"` explicitly only stops the log
carrying a WARNING that claims a resource the design never gets, which is
exactly how the misread happened.

**TIMING's own prediction was refuted on both limbs** and it says so: it
predicted the placer would either fail or stay near 6.32, and neither happened.
The pre-registered threshold of 48,000 CLB was not met at 49,497, so by the
letter the claim survives and by its spirit it does not.

**TIMING's withdrawn 93.2% and this measured 92.9% agree, and that is TWO ERRORS
CANCELLING, not vindication.** Section 7a inflated density for an
architecturally backwards reason AND under-estimated achievable density under
pressure, by similar amounts in opposite directions. **The 93.2% stays
withdrawn**; reasoning is what gets reused and none of that reasoning was right.

**AND THE CATCH, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE REAL RESULT. The squeeze bought CLB
capacity in exactly the currency this design has already run out of.** WNS went
**-3.056 to -3.658**, and the router had already declared, at the LOOSER
density, that `[Route 35-447] congestion is preventing the router from routing
all nets`. At 7.029 there is less routing resource per cell, not more.

**"Fits by CLB count" and "builds" are different claims, and this experiment
moved only the first.** A design at 92.9% CLB and 7.029 density gives the router
a HARDER job than the one that already failed. Nobody may quote a percentage
from the table above as a fit verdict.

**Everything containing "+ lever C" is gated on TRACK CBINFER**, which is
answering LEVERC's own first open item: whether Vivado infers LUTRAM from
`cb`'s array-of-array-of-`signed` at all. If it does not, lever C is 1,536
register copies, strictly worse than today, and those rows are moot.

**The fit needs THREE levers, and the ordering is not what anyone assumed:**

| configuration | CLB |
|---|---:|
| today | 121% |
| + lever C alone (IQ4_NL codebook to LUTRAM) | 115.9% |
| **+ `d_norm/gvr.u_rms` read muxes alone** | **102.2%** |
| + lever C + norm gain image out of LUTs | 105.2% |
| + all three | 94.6% |

**`d_norm` alone beats lever C alone by 13.7 points and nobody was working on
it.** It is 43,213 LUT plus 17,696 MUXF7 of 1024:1 read muxes, it has **never
run on silicon** (the token run's 64 RMS norms ran on the host), so it carries
less regression risk than lever C, which is inside `matvec_core`.

**Caveats that bound all of the above, and must travel with it:**
- The 94.6% row is **overstated by ~17,405 LUT**: TRACK NORMURAM MEASURED that
  "+32,943" is the saving from DROPPING the gain image, not MOVING it, because
  any real gain pays a 17,367 LUT `w_mant` fold wherever the table lives.
- The norm-image term is the best of six draws of the one quantity SCATTER
  ruled **NOT SAFE to quote as a point** (82,597..128,065). Range or nothing.
- `compose4` **wires nothing to anything** -- no inter-subsystem nets, no host
  plumbing. The real top adds logic and nets on top of 420,240. The total is a
  FLOOR.
- A `pblock_squeeze` (netlist unchanged, die restricted to 46,920 CLB) is in
  flight and is **the only measurement** of packing under pressure. Everything
  else about density is inference.

### The engine runs at 1/22 speed and the cause is the address map, not the RTL

DERIVED before fitting, then MEASURED to 0.32%: one core weight word is
24 weight + 3 scale beats = 27 x 32 B = 864 B; one 256-bit HBM port at 250 MHz
is 8.000 GB/s; 27 beats through ONE port = 21.60 core cycles at 200 MHz.
**Measured slope 21.67.** The card sustains 7.39-7.88 GB/s -- 92-99% of exactly
one AXI port, with 26 idle -- because **235 of 250 tensors have all 27 lane
sub-regions inside ONE 256 MiB segment**, which is the pseudo-channel granule.

The attribution control is what makes it solid: the same shipping RTL with only
the memory model swapped runs at **1.60 cycles/beat at identical `MAXOUT=16`,
`MAXB=16`, `DEPTH=512`** -- which kills the outstanding-read hypothesis
outright, including TRACK A7's `outst` depth.

**Fix is in the packer, not the RTL.** Supply model `max(1.60 datapath, M/1.25
memory)` where M = lanes per pseudo-channel: M=1 and M=2 both give **1.60**, M=3
gives 2.40, M=27 gives 21.60. **M=2 is exactly the knee**, so the shipping
default is 27 lanes on 25 segments, max 2 per PC: full datapath-floor
throughput at **75,340 tokens**, against Oren's stated 64k requirement.
**The model has NO anchor at M=2** -- flagged as its largest unhedged
assumption.

**BLOCKED:** `gen_layer_program.py` correctly refuses a striped manifest rather
than emitting a wrong program, so **nothing can emit a token program for a
striped set** until TRACK STRIPEPATH lands. The card experiment cannot run
before then.

### Decisions taken by Oren, with their triggers

- **N2 = option (a)**: the seam in front of D. "We don't want host controlling."
  `rtl/fk33_seam.vhd` landed (`9270c7a`). **`0xE000` is still assigned nowhere
  in `gen_pcieep.py`** -- the block has registers and no address.
- **Context requirement is 64k**, not 262,144. Ceiling on one card is ~202,681,
  but **X1 must be checked against the SHIPPING striping layout, never against
  202,681**, which describes a configuration nobody intends to build.
- **9B is single-card.** Two cards buy a fit and context, **not speed**.
  MEASURED: `attn_mac_array` is **exactly invariant under tensor parallelism**
  because `G := N_QH/N_KVH` divides numerator and denominator by the same N --
  the N=2 draw returned **298 DSP, identical to N=1, to the unit**. The ladder
  that does shrink it (`QH_TILE` below `G`) is available at N=1 with no second
  card, no subsystem E and no peer link. Reopens only on context, a bigger
  model, or batching.
- **Lever C reopened** by its own stated trigger. Its closure had been
  discharged against the subsystem-A-only PBLOCK route, not against A+B+C+D.

### The defect class this project keeps finding

**Guards that pass for the wrong reason. Six more today**, in addition to the
four already recorded:

1. `check_hbm_stack.py` PASSED over **7,154 ranges of which zero exist**.
2. The **42-field descriptor cross-check cannot see a wrong address.** With a
   piece's address mutated, `make_plan` reported **69 of 69 fields agree** --
   the placement is on both sides and cancels. It had the same defect via
   `hbm_base`. This is the check that was described everywhere as "gates every
   job".
3. `gen_layer_program.py --token` on a striped set emitted **311 of 311 A jobs,
   0 refused, all 6,723 bases byte-identical to the flat program's** -- a
   complete, gateware-acceptable, wrong program reported as success.
4. `tb_attn_block` -- the bench named after the unit, carrying subsystem C's
   bit-exact oracle -- **passes a deliberately broken min-fold tree**.
5. Lever C's closure in this file, discharged against the wrong design.
6. The 2026-08-25 capacity table's "9B fits with ~2.9 GiB spare" **counted
   weights only**; at 262,144 the real figure is 9.625 GB against 8.590 GB. It
   underwrote the single-card strategy for five days and survives only because
   the answer came back 64k.

**And one model failure of a different shape:** a one-parameter packing model
calibrated on a single placed design was wrong by **12 points with its sign
inverted**. It was correctly labelled ESTIMATE with its assumption stated, and
that was not enough. See CLAUDE.md.

### The machine

The workstation **hung hard at 01:25** under six concurrent Vivados --
`kcompactd0` stuck 75 s, RCU stalls, nine CPUs in soft lockup, power button,
FPGA configuration lost, ninety minutes of place-and-route destroyed. **A single
composed route leaves 233 MB free while ALONE on the box**, so no pre-flight
`free` check could ever have caught it. Rules in CLAUDE.md; the second lane
(BC-250) was idle at load 0.07 the entire night and was never used.

**The card is currently UNCONFIGURED** -- slot power was cut -- and nothing has
been reprogrammed since.

## THE REFILL RULE (read this first, every time)

**Standing instruction from Oren, 2026-08-28: the parallel slots must not go
empty while the backlog is non-empty, and this runs overnight.**

So: **every time an agent completes, before writing the report, check the
BACKLOG below and dispatch the next ready item.** Closing a track and refilling
its slot are one action, not two. It is easy to land a result, write it up well,
and only then notice that four slots have been idle for the whole write-up --
that happened once already today and Oren caught it, not me.

Target **four concurrent tracks**. Fewer only when the backlog genuinely has
nothing whose dependencies are met. If that ever happens, say so explicitly
rather than quietly running one agent.

A backlog item is READY when its file ownership does not collide with a running
track and its listed dependency has landed. If nothing is ready, the right move
is to look for what the last few results NEWLY unblocked, because every landing
today opened at least one new item.

**Discipline for closing a track.** When an agent lands, do exactly one of:

- **MARK OFF** the branch that fired, move the row to the Landed table with its
  commit, and dispatch whatever that branch names.
- **WRITE THE ISSUE DOWN** in Open issues below, with the evidence, then either
  send the agent a follow-up (if the fix is determined) or raise it with Oren
  (if it is a decision rather than a fix). Never silently retry.

Status values: `RUNNING`, `LANDED`, `BLOCKED-DECISION` (needs Oren),
`BLOCKED-DEP` (waiting on another track).

## WHAT STANDS BETWEEN THIS PROJECT AND 9B INFERENCE ON THE CARD

**Added 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT. Every fact here is MEASURED against the
tree at `5a19f984`, and the audit went looking for it because several tracks
had each said a piece of it in their own write-ups and no place on this board
said it whole.**

**The one-sentence answer: the design routes, a bitstream exists and is loaded,
the 9B weights are resident in HBM and verified against a digest the loader did
not produce -- and NOTHING HAS VERIFIED WHAT ANY OF IT COMPUTES, because the
card carries subsystem A alone and no tool in this repository can start a job
on it.**

The five things that are true, in the order they were established:

1. **The bitstream routes and loads.** `ed1ffe2`, 0 nets with routing errors,
   288,506 fully routed, `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep_eng.bit` 22,568,402 bytes.
   Loaded on card 1: configures, links Gen3 x4, identifies as `0x464B3333`,
   SYSMON reads through the design, BAR writes work, the DMA BRAM and both HBM
   stacks round-trip. `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_first-engine-load-on-card.md`.
2. **The weights are on the card and are the right bytes.** 4,487,442,432 B
   written in 8.76 s and read back and matched against the manifest's pack-time
   `blake2b_128` and an independently written header parse. TRACK WEIGHTS,
   `9d7a9e5`. That write-up's own words: **"a loaded magazine, not a fired shot."**
3. **The card carries subsystem A and nothing else.** MEASURED:
   `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` instantiates `matvec_int4_desc_axi` and no
   other work unit. There is no B, no C, no D on the silicon.
4. **No host tool can start a job on it.** MEASURED: `gen_pcieep.py` puts the
   engine's register map at `ENG_CTL_BASE = 0x00012000`;
   `grep -rn '0x12000\|ENG_CTL' hw/fk33/host/ server/ tools/` returns nothing.
   `fk33_regs.h` has no engine block. `fk33ctl.py` has ten commands and none of
   them starts an operation.
5. **The host seam that WAS written targets a contract no gateware implements.**
   MEASURED: `server/fk33_seam.h` defines `FK33_SEAM_*` with magic `"LLM2"` at a
   base its own comment calls **PROPOSED, NOT DECIDED**; no file under `rtl/` or
   `hw/fk33/rtl/` mentions it. `server/pl_backend.c`'s third line says
   **"Nothing here has ever run against the card."**

**So there are three gaps, not one, and they are of different kinds.**

- A **tooling** gap: N1, the host-side runner for one A job, checked against
  `ref/matvec_int4.c`. Writable and testable with **no hardware** through
  `fk33_transport_open_sim`/`_filedir`; only the final run needs the bench.
- A **decision** gap: N2, whether the seam or the descriptor plane is the
  contract. Nobody should pick this for Oren.
- A **design** gap: N3, an RTL top that composes A+B+C+D for the card. It does
  not exist. `rtl/llama_top.vhd` composes all four but is a simulation top: it
  binds `matvec_int4`, which has no descriptor plane, and `C_REAL`, `C_KV_AXI`,
  `NORM_REAL` and `B_SRC_REAL` all default FALSE. N3 is blocked on B+C+D
  fitting, which is WRITEDEC and N5.

**The ordering matters and the cheap step is first.** N1 is small, needs no
decision and no new RTL, and it is the only one of the three that converts
"9B inference on the card" from an unfalsifiable claim into a measurable one.
Every schedule below it rests on arithmetic nobody has ever checked on this
silicon.

## File ownership, right now

Two agents editing one file has already cost this project real time. Nothing
below may be edited by a track that does not own it.

**REWRITTEN 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT. The table it replaces named four
tracks that had landed days earlier (C-ORACLE, B-ACCURACY, TOK-C, A-CTRL) and
named none of the tracks actually running that night.** An ownership table that
lists dead owners is worse than none: it makes free files look taken and taken
files look free, and both errors cost a dispatch.

| path | owner | note |
|---|---|---|
| `sim/regress.sh` | **SHARED** | any track adding a test edits it. Re-read it immediately before editing, keep the edit to the rows you add, and re-check `BASELINE_PASS` at commit time. Editing it under a running instance is already safe; see the note below. |
| `rtl/rmsnorm_rs.vhd`, `rtl/gdn_block.vhd`, `rtl/attn_block.vhd`, `sim/ooc_writedec_*`, `hw/fk33/results/writedec_*` | **TRACK WRITEDEC** | RUNNING. Has already committed `51323ca` for `rmsnorm_rs` and is working through `gdn_block` and `attn_block`. |
| `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`, `sim/realshape_gate.sh`, `sim/elab9b_run.sh`, `rtl/attn_kv_axi.vhd`, `rtl/attn_c_ports_skel.vhd` | **TRACK KVVALUE** | RUNNING |
| `rtl/llama_top.vhd`, `rtl/hbm_tg.vhd`, the `sim/micro` copies | **TRACK CLOG2TOP** | RUNNING |
| `docs/WORKLOG.md` | **TRACK BOARDAUDIT** | RUNNING, exclusively, by arrangement with Oren for the duration of the audit. Released when this track reports. |
| `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`, `hw/fk33/*.tcl`, `hw/fk33/*.xdc`, `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py`, `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` | free | released by TRACK SHELL at `928ad9f`, then by TRACK PBLOCK at `ed1ffe2`. `rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` is GENERATED, so edit `gen_fk33_engine.py`. **Wanted by backlog rows N3 and N4.** |
| `hw/fk33/host/fk33_load_weights.py` | **A TRACK IS ACTIVE HERE** | Committed `4b26b7e` and `6d9c857` on 2026-08-29 while BOARDAUDIT was running: the fast residency check passed an object neither check ever read. Track name not declared in either message. **Treat as owned until it reports.** |
| `hw/fk33/host/**` except `fk33_load_weights.py` | free | never claimed by a track. **Wanted by backlog row N1**, which is the first thing to dispatch. N1 adds a NEW file and edits `fk33_regs.h`, so it does not collide with the loader work above -- but confirm that before dispatching, because this row was measured wrong once already tonight. |
| `rtl/attn_*.vhd` (except `attn_kv_axi`, `attn_c_ports_skel`, `attn_block`), `sim/tb_attn_*.vhd`, `ref/attn_*` | free | released by TRACK C-ORACLE `8baa413`, TRACK C-SEAM and TRACK RY-ORACLE |

| `tools/qwen35_tokenizer.py`, `tools/*tokenizer*`, `server/**` | free | released by TRACK TOK-C `0181cc3` and TRACK SERVER `3963a60`. **Wanted by N2 once the decision is made.** |
| `rtl/matvec_int4*.vhd`, `rtl/weight_streamer.vhd`, `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`, `rtl/axi_rd_fsm.vhd`, `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `hw/mv_driver.c`, matvec benches | free | released by TRACK A-CTRL `a4f7e17` and TRACK OUTMODE `0ff6828`. **Wanted by backlog rows N7, N8 and N10.** |

**A COMPLETED AGENT CAN STILL WAKE UP AND COMMIT.** Observed 2026-08-28: the
subsystem-A-sim track reported done, was superseded, and then woke hours later
and committed `2b12a7b` while TRACK A-CTRL already owned those files. It landed
clean (a doc correction plus a comment in `sim/regress.sh`, `BASELINE_PASS`
untouched, the bench itself not touched) so nothing was lost, but that was
luck rather than design. Consequences:

- "Completed" is not "released". A track's ownership row stays until its files
  are verified quiescent, not merely until its report arrives.
- After any late commit, re-run the affected tests yourself rather than
  trusting either agent's report. That agent explicitly said its own
  confirmation run never returned and declined to claim it, which was the right
  call; the run was completed separately and all three passed.
- Prefer giving a superseded track NO further instructions. Sending it a
  follow-up is what turns a harmless late commit into a genuine collision.

**`git commit -m msg -- <paths>` COMMITS THE WORKING TREE, NOT THE INDEX.
THREE INDEPENDENT TRACKS HIT THIS ON THE SAME DAY** -- C-ORACLE, B-ACCURACY,
and me, the last of them one commit after documenting it. B-ACCURACY hit it in
its most deceptive form: it staged a single hunk of the shared `regress.sh`
with `git apply --cached` and then named the file on the commit line, which
discarded the careful staging entirely. It caught this only because the
committed `--stat` disagreed with the staged one, 22 lines against 7.

Three instances in a day means this is not an advisory to be more careful; it
is a property of the command that has to be worked around structurally. **On a
shared file: stage the hunk, then commit with NO pathspec.**
Observed 2026-08-28: TRACK C-ORACLE's first commit swept in TRACK A-CTRL's
uncommitted `sim/regress.sh` edits (`BASELINE_PASS=78`, rows for tests whose
files were not committed yet) purely because they were sitting in the working
tree at that path. It caught this and amended them out, and HEAD is clean, but
the pathspec form is the exact form this project's standing instruction
mandates in order to AVOID `git add -A`, so the two rules fight each other on
shared files.

The rule that resolves it: **for a SHARED file, run `git diff -- <file>` and
confirm every hunk is yours BEFORE committing.** If it is not, stage only your
hunks with `git add -p` and then commit with no pathspec so the index is what
lands. For files only your track owns, the pathspec form is still correct and
still the default.

An amend is only available while the bad commit is still the tip. Two tracks
committing within a minute of each other would have made it permanent.

**Editing `sim/regress.sh` under a running instance is ALREADY SAFE, and you
do not need to `pgrep` first.** bash reads a script lazily by byte offset, so
in general editing a script mid-run resumes the shell mid-token and the process
that dies is not the one that edited it. `sim/regress.sh` was bitten by exactly
this three times during its own development, once to a third party, so section
0 now copies the file to a private temp path, syntax-checks the copy in case
the original was mid-write, and re-execs that (`:287`, `:299`). From then on
the running process reads a file nobody else can name.

Recorded because a track disclosed having edited it during another run and
could not rule out damage. There was none, and there could not have been. The
disclosure was still the right call: reporting a suspected collision you cannot
disprove is worth more than a silent hope, and the answer only took one grep.

**CORRECTION, appended: commit `4891c6d` mixes two authors' work.** Its
message describes only my `regress.sh` note; everything else in it is TRACK
A-CTRL's own worklog update, swept in by a pathspec commit while A-CTRL was
editing the same file. Nothing was lost and A-CTRL's content is intact; the
defect is a message that described half its contents. It could not be amended,
because another track committed on top within the minute -- which is the
failure mode recorded two paragraphs above, reproduced against its own author
inside an hour.

The root cause is worth more than the incident. I ran the prescribed check,
saw it print DIRTY, and committed anyway, because I had chained the check and
the commit into one command so the check merely PRECEDED the action instead of
GATING it. **A check whose result you do not branch on is decoration.** Run the
check as its own step, read it, then act.

**Standing rule for every track: no hardware.** No `xsdb`, `hw_server`,
`vivado ... program`, `pcieep.sh`, `jtag.sh`, `flash.sh`, `program.tcl`, and
nothing that opens `/dev/xdma*`. A live FK33 is in this session, and an agent
has already destroyed its factory flash image by crossing that line.

## In flight

**This section is REWRITTEN at every dispatch, not appended to.** I set that
rule on 2026-08-29 after an independent review found it listing two tracks as
RUNNING a day after both landed, and then broke it myself across eight
consecutive dispatches. Appending is one action and retiring a row is another,
and only the first feels like progress. If this table names a track that has
landed, the table is the defect.

**Corrected 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT: BGATE2 had LANDED (`dfe308c`) and
was still listed here as RUNNING, which is the defect this section's own rule
names. It is moved to Landed. BOARDAUDIT is added, because it was running and
was not listed.**

**REWRITTEN 2026-08-31 by the dispatcher.** The four rows this table carried
(READCONV, ACOV, NWROM, GRAY1) were all long landed or answered: READCONV's
question was subsumed by RMSMUX/RMSWIRE (the read muxes are gone, measured),
ACOV is backlog row N8 (open, undispatched), NWROM was answered by NORMURAM
and GWTWO (the image is in BRAM at 135 tiles, then the codebook at ~99), and
GRAY1 is backlog row N10 (open, undispatched). Naming them here as RUNNING was
the defect this section's own rule describes.

**REWRITTEN 2026-09-14 by the dispatcher.** Both rows this table carried
(CARDOOC running, CARDSMALL scheduled) are CLOSED. CARDOOC was stopped by Oren
at 60.5 h; CARDSMALL and seven follow-on probe rounds answered the question.

| track | state | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **CARDOOC** | **STOPPED 2026-09-14 by Oren, at 60.5 h** | Never left `RTL Elaboration`. Stopping it returned `MemAvailable` 2,346 -> **26,923 MB** and swap used 24,155 -> 3,417 MB. |
| **CARDSMALL + rounds 1-8** | **CLOSED** | The wall is INSIDE `RTL Elaboration`, and the trigger is the inter-subsystem WIRING. See `docs/debugging/2026-09-14_the-wall-is-a-3d-ram-vivado-warned-about.md`. |

**The Vivado lanes are now BOTH FREE.** Workstation: 26.9 GB available, zero
Vivado. BC-250: zero Vivado.

### What rounds 0-8 established

**The wall is in `RTL Elaboration`**, proven by `synth_design -rtl` with
`fk33_engine` as the control: the control completes in 115 s
(`Finished RTL Optimization Phase 1`), while `fk33_llama_top` and `fk33_card`
print `Starting RTL Elaboration` at t = 4 s and never print `Finished`.

**The trigger is the wiring, not the parts.** Two tops carry A+B+C+D at the real
9B shape and differ in exactly one property:

| top | wired between subsystems? | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `compose4_top` | **NO** (co-residency; `gen_compose4_top.py` says so outright) | synthesises, places, **ROUTES**: WNS -0.422, 286,806 nets |
| `fk33_llama_top` | **YES** (sequencer glue, region-file client muxing) | never finishes RTL Elaboration |

**Every individual entity elaborates and synthesises fine**, in seconds to
minutes: `vec_mem` 17 s, `sampler_stream` 17 s, `seq_vec_issue` 17 s,
`region_mem` 46 s, `rmsnorm_rs_mem` 58 s, `matvec_int4_desc_axi` 166 s,
`fk33_engine` 170 s.

**Nothing reachable by a generic changes it**: context (32x), `C_REAL`,
`C_KV_AXI`, `NORM_REAL`, `B_STATE_AXI`, `HOST_WINDOW`, and all three
`-flatten_hierarchy` modes are indistinguishable. `A_DESC` and `A_ROWS_IF`
cannot be varied at all (`8-549` port width mismatch).

**`-flatten_hierarchy none` is REFUTED as this flow's justification.**
`ooc_card_dcp.tcl`'s header rests the whole approach on it; `none`, `rebuilt`
and `full` differ by under one second and 0.02 GiB.

**A 60-hour question is now a 5-minute one.** `-rtl` on `fk33_llama_top`
reproduces the wall in 37 s.

### Measured, and worth keeping

- **`HOST_WINDOW => false` is worth 100 BRAM tiles and 7,176 LUT.** Isolated
  `region_mem`: `false` gives lut=4038 ff=27 **ramb=100**; `true` gives
  lut=11214 ff=3611 **ramb=0**. This CONFIRMS `region_mem.vhd`'s header claim
  ("a memory with a combinational read port CANNOT be a BRAM") by measurement,
  and the card's setting is correct.
- **First UNTHROTTLED card-OOC memory figure: 7.97 GiB** (`memory.events`
  `high 0, max 0, oom 0`). Every previous card figure was a cap.
- **The card half wants at least 39.1 GiB**, not the 15.52 GB the tcl header
  claimed; that figure was a mid-run sample of a job that never finished.

### Named lead, NOT measured

`fk33_llama_top`'s **per-client element port muxing** around the region file --
the file's own words are "Per-CLIENT element ports, muxed below", where a client
is not a unit ("unit V is an ADAPTER in front of NVOP engines, and each engine
needs its own port"). A combinational mux across clients x `NREGION` x `REGMAX`
is the shape that stalls elaboration. Test by reducing the client count or mux
width and re-running `-rtl`.

**CARDSMALL was a SCALING PROBE, not an attribution experiment** (historical; it returned a null result and rounds 1-8 followed). `C_MAXPOS`
and `C_CTXLEN` move together deliberately as one "context size" axis. A result
does NOT attribute the wall to either generic individually, and must not be
written up as if it did.

Design notes, because `fk33_card` has **no generic clause at all** (it is
generated by `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py` and hardcodes the generic map into
`fk33_llama_top`), so `-generic` cannot reach the shape -- the recorded rule
that **`-generic` reaches only the TOP's generics, never a deep instance**
applies here:

- Both inputs are DERIVED ON THE BC-250 from the synced tree at run time, by
  `sed` over `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` and `hw/fk33/ooc_card_dcp.tcl`, so
  they cannot drift from it. The repo files are never modified.
- The card `sed` is asserted to change **exactly 2 lines**, and the tcl `sed`
  is asserted both to no longer read the full-shape card AND to read the
  reduced one. Either assertion failing aborts the point.
- The orchestrator refuses to start unless the SYNCED card is still
  full-shape (`131072`), so a probe cannot silently measure a reduced tree.
- Point 2 **chains on point 1's anchored sentinel** (`^CARDOOC_WROTE `), with
  the `/proc/PID/exe` presence check as the safety net -- per the recorded
  rule that presence is a lane check, not a queue, and two waiters on
  presence alone both start.
- A game-running check (`ps -eo comm=` matching `\.exe$`, never the full
  cmdline, because the Steam reaper carries the exe path in its own argv)
  holds the launch off if Oren is still using the box.
- `MemoryMax` + `MemorySwapMax` are the guard the 2026-09-05 incident lacked:
  a runaway gets its own cgroup killed instead of thrashing the box offline.

Memory budget at dispatch, stated per the global-budget rule: **workstation**
31 GiB, `llama-server` 18, `cardooc` 22.7 resident under a 24G cap, swap free
13.2 GB -- nothing new is launched here. **BC-250** 15.2 GB RAM + 47.4 GB free
swap, zero Vivado, one job capped at 12 GB RSS. Two lanes, one tool each; no
third Vivado anywhere.

**TRACK CARDTOP was dispatched and RECALLED the same hour, 2026-08-31.** It
went to a harness subagent, and Oren's ruling is that the subagent model is
not strong enough for VHDL/RTL design work. **No subagents for RTL tracks
from here.** Audit on recall: no commits, no edits to any tracked file; its
only output was four new files, quarantined UNREVIEWED to
`/mnt/storage/cardtop_flash_draft_2026-08-31/` (a 5,363-line
`fk33_llama_top.vhd` draft plus three sketches). Do not copy anything back
without a full review. STEP 3 (row N3) returns to undispatched; when it runs,
it runs in the dispatcher's own session.

The dispatcher also holds: teeth Run B (gate for the floor-103 commit), then
the full gate on the final tree at the new HEAD.

### The fit, corrected. MY ARITHMETIC WAS STRUCTURALLY WRONG.

I told the board that NORMADAPT's 129,877 LUT target was "four times the
31,359 `pb_core` gap". **That subtraction was never valid**, and NORMADAPT
caught it: the 31,359 shortfall comes from the OPTIMISTIC booking, whose
`D_norm` is the bare `rmsnorm_rs` with **no adapter storage at all**. You
cannot reduce a shortfall computed from a total that never contained the thing
you removed. The 129,877 figure was also a MODEL and overstates by 52% -- the
real adapter's own logic is 102,204, and `wv` **does not exist in `llama_top`**.

MEASURED position now: **realistic B+C+D = 273,844 LUT**, over the device by
**5,622** and over `pb_core` by **40,079**, against 350,457 before NORMADAPT.
What NORMADAPT actually bought was collapsing the gap between the optimistic
and realistic bookings from 85,333 to **8,720**. **READCONV is the remaining
lever**, and TRACK NWROM may yet move the number the wrong way.

## ROW N1 IS ANSWERED. SUBSYSTEM A COMPUTES CORRECTLY ON THE FK33.

MEASURED 2026-08-29 20:12-20:16 by the dispatcher on card 1, under Oren's
one-night authorisation. **Twelve jobs. All eight distinct `(M, K)` geometries
in the 9B model. Every mantissa and every `y_exp` bit-identical to
`ref/matvec_int4.c`.** `err_code=0x0 (EC_NONE)` throughout; `BEATS` matched
`tiles*nblk` exactly every time. Write-up:
`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_first-arithmetic-on-the-silicon.md`.

The load-bearing row is `blk.11.attn_k.weight --rows 100`: that is the **exact
argv `sim/regress.sh:1428` feeds `sim/tb_matvec_fk33`**, on a byte-identical
file, so the card and the simulator agree on the same job. The two awkward
geometries were chosen deliberately: `M = 8224` is the only shape in the model
that is **not** a multiple of 32, and `M = 248320` is the lm_head (run at 64
rows, one window inside the 17,408 cap -- this does **NOT** contradict LMHEAD's
finding that the gateware refuses it as one job).

**Every result is unconfounded by THERM-255, and that was checked rather than
assumed:** counter cleared at 20:12:27, read 0 before and after every job,
`LATCHED TRIP none since the last clear` still true at 20:16.

**What this does NOT establish:** subsystem A alone. `fk33_engine.vhd`
instantiates `matvec_int4_desc_axi` and nothing else, so **B, C and D have
never run on this silicon** -- row N3 stands. One activation vector per job,
supplied by the host; nothing here exercises a layer, a sequence or the KV
cache. And one row-count per geometry, so an off-by-one at a window boundary
is not excluded.

**Tracks that landed and appear NOWHERE on this board, found by TRACK BOARDAUDIT
2026-08-29.** Each has a full write-up in `docs/debugging/` and none is named in
any Landed row. Recorded here rather than reconstructed into rows, because the
write-ups are the artefact and the point is that the board lost them:
**PBLOCK** (`ed1ffe2`, `2026-08-29_shell-pblock.md` -- the routed bitstream),
**FIRSTLOAD** (`2026-08-29_first-engine-load-on-card.md` -- the bitstream loads,
links and identifies; three instrument defects; the memory finding raised then
withdrawn),
**CARD2** (`2026-08-29_second-fk33-verify-and-flash-backup.md` -- card 2 works,
its factory flash is dumped and double-read),
**SERVER** (`3963a60`, `2026-08-29_host-seam-v2.md` -- backlog row 5),
**B-RECUR** (`ea26eec`, `2026-08-29_gdn-recur-coverage-and-dm.md` -- backlog row 8),
**SPECREC** (`f65e2bc`, `2026-08-29_spec-reconciliation.md` -- backlog row 9;
this one DOES have a Landed row, so the board contradicted itself),
**CAPTURE** (`2026-08-29_capture-llama-top-r9bs.md`),
**C-SEAM** (`2026-08-29_c-seam-layer-interleave.md`),
**CDC-STATIC** (`be982b3`, `2026-08-29_cdc-static-analysis.md`),
**ADDRARENA** (`2026-08-29_addrarena-one-hbm-map.md`),
**EMBED-BF16** (`2026-08-29_embedding-bf16-upgrade.md`),
**HOST-EMBED** (`2026-08-29_host-embedding-gather.md`),
**REFTOKEN** (`2026-08-29_ref-token-automatic-verdict.md`),
**LOGITS-SEAM** (`2026-08-29_logits-seam-model.md`),
**GDN-ORACLE** (`2026-08-29_gdn-block-oracle.md`).
**MEASURED: `grep -ci` on this file for each of those filenames returned 0.**
Three of the four dispatches wasted today were onto work whose write-up was
sitting in `docs/debugging/` unreferenced.

**CORRECTION, appended the same night: fifteen was a sample, and the real
figure is far worse.** A full inventory of all **91** write-ups dated 2026-08-28
or 2026-08-29 measured that only about **18 have a row in the Landed table at
all**. The remainder split two ways, and the second is the larger problem:

* **18 tracks are named ONLY by the bare "Landed since the last rewrite"
  sentence above** -- OI3B, COMPOSE, WEIGHTS, REALSHAPE, REALFIX, SEAMGATE,
  RY-MODEL, SCHED-FIX, ORDINAL, ARENA-MANIFEST, KVSIZE, CGENERICS, BUILD-E2E,
  GATEHYGIENE, BTOP1, LUTDIET, CKVMAP, CLOG2. Every one is committed and fully
  written up, and none has a commit, a result or a single line a reader
  scanning `## Landed` would ever see. **A name-drop is not a record.** That
  sentence is the single densest piece of under-recording on this board.
* **Roughly 35 more appear NOWHERE**: no filename, no track name, no commit.
  They include whole subsystems of the day's work -- `fk33-spi-flash-boot`,
  `fk33-thermal-protection`, `fk33-free-running-observability`,
  `hbm-stack-boundary-straddle`, `llama-top-first-seams`,
  `subsystem-c-top-and-mac-array`, `cdc-and-fifo-coverage`,
  `codebook-coherency-oracle`, `three-range-defects` (the commit that actually
  fixed OI-2, OI-7 and OI-8), and `thermal-guard-255-trips`, **which is an OPEN
  hardware defect and is now recorded as THERM-255 above.**

**The generalisation, and it is the reason the board keeps failing this way.**
The commit log cannot be used to recover this: only **2 of 183** commits since
2026-08-28 use the `TRACK X:` convention, and 95 distinct message prefixes were
counted. **The reliable index is the write-up header**, because nearly every
file in `docs/debugging/` declares its own track and, where it has one, its own
backlog row number. Anyone auditing this board again should start there and not
with `git log`. And the cheap fix for the future is one line: **when a track
lands, its Landed row cites the write-up FILENAME**, so a `grep` can find it.

**AN OPEN CONTRADICTION, RECORDED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER.** CKVMAP reported
"the real 9B KV map elaborates" (2,452,864 kB / 2.36 s, `realshape_gate` PASS
24). CLOG2 reported, as its load-bearing finding, that **`C_MAXPOS = 131,072`
cannot elaborate and fixing `clog2` cannot make it**: the argument is
6,803,283,968, **3.2x `natural'high`**, so it cannot be FORMED as a `natural`;
a perfect `clog2(natural)` moves the ceiling only to 123,361, still short; and
at 131,072 the overflow moves EARLIER, into `llama_top`'s own
`constant KVREG_B : natural := C_LAY*C_NKVH*C_MAXPOS*REC_B_C` = 2,281,701,376.
Both may be true of different configurations -- CKVMAP deliberately did not
change the default and called the real map a build configuration. **TRACK
CLOG2TOP is dispatched to settle it.** `C_MAXPOS = 131,072` is Oren's decision
and is not being reopened; if it does not elaborate, it gets made to.

**Two of my own framings were wrong and are corrected here.** (1) I told CLOG2
that `llama_top:785` "blamed a bystander"; it MEASURED that `:785` WAS the
failing `while` line inside the local `clog2`. **Missing attribution, not
misattribution** -- it names the function correctly and fails to name the
caller. (2) I said fixing `clog2` would unblock the KV map. It does not and
cannot; that is what the `clog2(unsigned)` overload exists for, and on the real
value it returns **33**, exactly `C_KV_ADDR_W`, corroborating CGENERICS'
zero-slack finding by an independent route.

**B+C+D CLOSES, and the cheapest fix is not the one anyone expected.** LUTDIET
(`4950666`) MEASURED that decoding the variable-index write with a per-word
generate and a CONSTANT index takes `rmsnorm_rs` from 169,746 to **40,804 LUT**
at identical ports, identical FF, identical WNS and **zero BRAM** -- a 76%
reduction with no memory and no interface change. That alone projects B+C+D at
**210,890 LUT against 233,765 free in `pb_core`**, against COMPOSE's 2.88x-over
starting point. The margin is 22,875 LUT, **9.8%**, which is positive and thin.

**It also corrected the mechanism, and the correction changes where to look.**
COMPOSE described the cost as a mux tree. The mux tree is **17.5%** of it.
**80.5% is the variable-index WRITE into the flat register, and that structure
uses ZERO MUXF7 and ZERO MUXF8** -- so hunting this cost by its F7/F8 signature
finds one fifth of it. Same split by netlist census in B (79.8% write / 8.9%
read, 88.7% of 585,430 primitives) and C (54.1% / 3.5%).

**Two of my own figures were wrong and are corrected here.** "Lose roughly 500K
to fit" was the DEVICE number; `pb_core` needs **538,135**. And COMPOSE
UNDERSTATED the composition: it booked D's norm at 169,746, the unit WITHOUT
the vector storage `llama_top` must add, while B and C included theirs. With
it, D's norm is 299,030 and B+C+D is ~901K, not 772K.

**`BASELINE_PASS` IS NOW 93, AND THE OLD 101 WAS UNREACHABLE ON EVERY TREE.**
GATEHYGIENE (`1399425`, `5154518`, `7676510`) found the gate had been printing
`REGRESSION: FAIL` for **every track since `e788a0e`**, including on the working
tree it was calibrated against. The planner globs `sim/tb_*.vhd` off the
FILESYSTEM and nothing distinguished a row backed by a committed file from a
private one, so two tracks counted the same two untracked benches and neither
was wrong on what it could see. 93 is a MEASURED clean-`git archive` ceiling
(97 rows, 4 NOCHECK, FAIL 0); the working tree measures **99**, the difference
being ~20 rows a clone does not get. The gate now names those rows and
**refuses to suggest raising the floor** while the list is non-empty.

**CGENERICS stopped rather than editing `rtl/llama_top.vhd` under BTOP1**, which
was the instruction and is why its remediation is a handoff rather than a
collision. That remediation -- encode C's KV bases in the format's own 16-byte
granule, `C_K_BASE_CH` 282,598,912 and `C_V_BASE_CH` 353,902,080 -- is the first
thing to dispatch when BTOP1 releases the file. It is blocked on CLOG2 too: the
chunk-domain sum needs a `clog2` that does not overflow.

**Standing instruction to every track: nothing may be run against the card.**
A SECOND FK33 arrived 2026-08-29; its factory flash image was backed up the
same day and is the only surviving copy of a SQRL factory image, card 1's
having been destroyed by an agent that crossed this line.

**This is NOT contradicted by the overnight authorisation in the Decisions
table, and the distinction is the whole point.** Oren authorised **himself**,
on 2026-08-29 only, to JTAG-configure card 1 and run host-side tests. That is a
DISPATCHER-level act by the person at the bench. **The TRACK-level prohibition
above is unchanged, unconditional and absolute**: no agent runs `xsdb`,
`hw_server`, `vivado ... program`, `pcieep.sh`, `jtag.sh`, `flash.sh`,
`program.tcl`, anything under `hw/fk33/host/`, or anything opening
`/dev/xdma*`, whatever any decision row says. A track that reads the
authorisation as applying to itself has misread it. Backlog row N1 is written
to respect exactly this split: an agent writes and fully exercises the runner
through `fk33_transport_open_sim`/`_filedir`, and only the final run is Oren's.

**This note previously said "there is no bitstream at present in any case".
That is no longer true.** TRACK PBLOCK's `ed1ffe2` produced a routed,
timing-clean bitstream (`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep_eng.bit`, 22,568,402 bytes).
The instruction is unchanged and now carries its full weight: the constraint is
the hardware boundary itself, not the absence of anything to load.

## Open, raised 2026-08-29, each needing a decision rather than more work

| # | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **BUILD-HANG** | **A FK33 shell build has been hung for 27.6 hours and nothing noticed.** MEASURED 2026-08-29 19:05 by reading `/proc`: pid 1043119 (`vrs`) has been blocked on `wait_on_run synth_1` since **Aug 28 15:27:12**, with **7 minutes of CPU across 27.6 hours** and 2.5 MB RSS. It is not slow, it is stopped. The cause is worse than a hang: `launch_runs` printed `Time (s): cpu = 00:00:17` and **reported success**, but `synth_1` **never started** -- there is no `runme.log`, no `.vivado.begin`/`.end` marker, and no `synth_1` directory in `fk33_pcieep.runs/` at all, only the `bd_*` sub-runs. `wait_on_run` then waited forever for a run that did not exist. The parent is reparented to systemd, so the agent that launched it is long gone and never got an answer. **This is the project's own recurring defect class in a new place: a command that returns success while doing nothing, paired with a wait that cannot time out.** Any future shell build can hit it, and the symptom is indistinguishable from a legitimately long place-and-route. Scratch is `<scratchpad>/pcieep3`, 138 MB, left intact for inspection. | **PROCESS CLEARED, DEFECT OPEN.** Oren approved the kill 2026-08-29; pids 1041037/1043086/1043119 are gone and 83 GB of cold scratch from landed tracks was cleared alongside it, taking root from 98% to **91%** (38 G to 121 G free). The `pcieep3` scratch was among the ten removed. **The defect itself is untouched:** the REAL fix is a bounded wait plus a post-`launch_runs` assertion that the run directory exists, and it belongs to whoever next owns `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`. Until then any shell build can hang indefinitely with a symptom indistinguishable from a long place-and-route. |
| **THERM-255** | **THE THERMAL GUARD TRIPPED 255 TIMES OVERNIGHT AND IT WAS NOT HEAT. OPEN, UNRESOLVED, AND RECORDED NOWHERE ON THIS BOARD UNTIL NOW.** Found by TRACK BOARDAUDIT 2026-08-29 in `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_thermal-guard-255-trips.md` (`0540c35`), which is an OPEN write-up whose own status line says a watcher is running. MEASURED on card 1 at `06:00.0` running `fk33_pcieep_therm.bit`: the trip counter was cleared to 0 and read **255** about 14 hours later, which is the SATURATING maximum of an 8-bit field, so the true count is 255 or more -- roughly **one trip every three minutes**. Every temperature was cool (die 35.3 C peak 37.3 against a 90 C halt; HBM 37/37 peak 38 against 85; both SYSMON stickies 0) and `trip_cause` was **0** on a saturated counter. What WAS set is `THERM_STATUS` bit 30, **the two HBM temperature copies disagreed, a CDC fault**. Working hypothesis, NOT confirmed: the HBM staleness path declares the sensor invalid after `G_STALE_MS` = 250 ms without a fresh accepted sample and correctly fails safe by treating an invalid sensor as HOT. **EACH TRIP HALTS THE COMPUTE DOMAIN.** | **OPEN, AND IT MATTERS TONIGHT.** Oren is authorised to load and run on card 1 on 2026-08-29 in order to answer backlog row N1. On a card doing real work this defect presents as **random stalls with no apparent cause**, and the write-up's own words are that it is "precisely the class of fault that gets attributed to the wrong subsystem for a week". **So before believing any N1 result, read the trip counter and the CDC sticky, and read them AFTER the run as well as before.** A stalled or wrong N1 result with a non-zero trip count is not evidence about subsystem A. **Measurement trap already recorded by that write-up and worth repeating here: a 60-second clean sample is NOT evidence of absence at a three-minute mean interval** -- twelve consecutive clean 5-second samples were taken and proved nothing. Note the engine build is a different bitstream from the thermal build this was seen on, so whether the same guard behaves this way in `fk33_pcieep_eng.bit` is itself unmeasured. |
| **IPREPO-DRIFT** | **Three copies of `util_pkg.vhd` under `ip_repo/*/src/` drift with nothing in the tree able to notice.** MEASURED by TRACK CLOG2TOP: they are regenerated from `rtl/` by `ip_repo/package_llama_ip.tcl`, and **nothing schedules that script** -- no gate row, no build script, and `sim/regress.sh` never mentions `ip_repo` at all. TRACK CLOG2's note that "the next packaging run fixes them" describes **a run that does not exist**. So `rtl/util_pkg.vhd` gained a corrected `clog2` tonight (`209d69e`) and the three IP copies still carry the overflowing doubling loop, silently. | **OPEN, no owner.** Two candidate fixes and they are not equivalent: a gate row that regenerates and diffs (catches drift, costs a Vivado invocation), or a cheap checker that compares the copies to `rtl/` byte-for-byte and refuses (catches drift with no Vivado, but cannot catch a packaging script that is itself wrong). Note this is the same class as the `sim/tr.txt` hole GATEHYGIENE closed: a load-bearing input that no gate reads. |
| **DESC-RULE2** | **`tools/gen_mv4i_desc.py`'s second base rule omits the `align4k()` that `ref/matvec_int4.c:474` and `tools/pack_int4.py:477` both apply.** MEASURED by TRACK AJOBRUN. At `GRP=1` with `K` in {4096, 12288}, `tiles*nb*port_b` is always a multiple of 4096, so **rule 2 agrees with rule 1 by coincidence of geometry on every file it has ever seen** -- and falsely refuses anything else (measured: `M=96 K=128` gives `[4096, 8192]` against `[4096, 4352]`). **That two-rule cross-check is the only guard against the one descriptor corruption the gateware cannot see**, so it is currently a guard that passes for the wrong reason. AJOBRUN's `selfcheck` carries a probe that MEASURES and PRINTS it without asserting, so it flips green when fixed. | **OPEN, no owner.** Small and self-contained. Worth doing before any shape outside the current model is packed, because the failure mode is a guard that has never actually discriminated. |
| **B-CONV-HIST** | **Raised by TRACK BTOP1 (`bf99d39`), and it is the cost of its own fix.** Opening `tvalid` so the causal conv has history turns `cvdata_p`'s zero taps from inert into a **live wrong number** under `B_SRC_REAL`: a zero mantissa carried at a real captured exponent. Both checkers refuse it independently -- `S_GO` asserts and `gdn_oracle.py` raises -- so this is not a silent defect, which is the good news. A real history needs a new `(KCONV-1) x qkv_dim` buffer, **ESTIMATE ~90 MB of GHDL signal at the 9B shape**, in the file TRACK REALFIX just fought a 46 GB signal down to make elaborate at all. BTOP1 **refused it rather than bodging it** and listed it open, which was right. Note `B_SRC_REAL` is already unrunnable for a separate `R_ALPHA` reason at `rtl/llama_top.vhd:52-58`, so nothing regresses today by leaving this. | **CLOSED AS WON'T-FIX, Oren, 2026-08-29.** `B_SRC_REAL` is not wanted, so the buffer is not built. **The two refusals stay and are the guard: `S_GO`'s assert and `gdn_oracle.py`'s raise must NOT be deleted as dead code by a later cleanup on the grounds that `B_SRC_REAL` is never true.** That deletion is exactly how a won't-fix becomes a silent defect. See the Decisions table; reopening requires fixing `R_ALPHA` first, so it is two problems, not one. |
| **B-BLK-1** | `rtl/gdn_block.vhd:958` maps value head h to key head `h/(VAL_HEADS/KEY_HEADS)` (contiguous) where the model tiles, `h mod KEY_HEADS`. MEASURED wrong on 30 of 32 value heads at the 9B shape. `VPK` appears in exactly one RTL file, so nothing downstream compensates. B spec sections 2.9 and 4 both give the RATIO and neither says WHICH heads, which is the proximate cause. | **DECIDED** 2026-08-29: fold into TRACK B-LAYER, now in flight |
| **BFP repack rule** | The 9B reference's float-to-BFP repack always normalises (`reg_put`, `exp = 14 - floor(log2(amax))`, no clamp); every shipping unit on the path clamps (`sh = max(0, msb_pos(amax) - 14)`) and so stays under-normalised on quiet blocks. MEASURED by RUNNING `rtl/bfp_pack.vhd`: 341 of 760 exponents differ, all quiet blocks, none loud, reconstructed VALUES exact. **193 of 490 BFP records per token (39.4%) are on the unclamped rule, so `--mode exact` reports a FALSE first divergence before reaching any real defect.** Three routes scoped in section 6 of REF9B's write-up; they are not equivalent. | **OREN'S CALL.** TRACK CAPTURE told to work around it and report which route the capture work says is needed, NOT to pick one |
| **`matvec_int4_axi` register 15** | No completeness guard and no idle interlock, so a partial codebook load through that plane is silently consumed. It is the standalone register-mapped plane; the FK33 path uses `matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd`, which loads all sixteen atomically and rejects an unloaded codebook with `EC_DESC`. | Left as a decision, not a fix. Not on the FK33 path |
| **OI-9 error-code space** | Full. Widen, subdivide via `ERR_INFO`, or take a reserved D value, with consequences for D. | **DECIDED, Oren, 2026-08-29: SUBDIVIDE VIA `ERR_INFO`**, because it leaves the byte layout untouched. No longer a decision; it is backlog row N12. D-PROG was told to STOP and report rather than choose, and that was right. |
| **AXIRD-FRST** | **`frst <= rst;` in `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`'s `g_sc` generate is DEAD, and this is the THIRD time it has been found.** Raised first by TRACK ACOV as its mutation row `B1`, flagged again to TRACK FLOOR, and written down here so a fourth rediscovery costs nothing. RE-MEASURED 2026-08-29 by TRACK FLOOR, by enumerating every occurrence of the signal in the file: declared `:157`, driven `:203` (inside `g_sc`) and `:241` (inside `g_dc`), and READ at only `:282` and `:292`, **both of which are inside `g_dc`**. Exactly one generate elaborates, so under `DUAL_CLK = false` the signal is driven and never read. The `g_sc` FSM and FIFO both take `rst => rst` directly. Harmless to the netlist -- synthesis drops a dangling driver -- but it reads as though the single-clock branch has a FIFO reset that is used, and it is a mutation site no bench can cover, which is why ACOV scored it. | **OPEN, and deliberately NOT fixed by TRACK FLOOR: `rtl/**` was outside its ownership and the correct move was to record it rather than reach.** The fix is one deleted line and belongs to whoever next owns `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`. Note the deletion is only safe together with the observation above that no read survives outside `g_dc`; a reader who deletes the `g_dc` assignment at `:241` instead breaks the dual-clock path. **RE-VERIFIED AT HEAD 2026-08-29 by TRACK STRAYROW, and THE LINE NUMBERS ABOVE ARE NOW STALE** -- `75f95a8` (TRACK A7) added `abort_c` and the `gate_chk` process to the same file and moved everything down. Identify it by CONTENT, not by line: the dead driver is the bare `frst    <= rst;` that is the FIRST statement inside `g_sc`, and the live one is `frst  <= rst_s2;` inside `g_dc`. MEASURED at `75f95a8` with `grep -n frst rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd` against the generate boundaries from `grep -n 'generate' rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`: declared `:157`; driven `:239` (inside `g_sc`, which spans `:236`-`:273`) and `:309` (inside `g_dc`, `:276`-`:372`); READ only at `:357` and `:367`, both inside `g_dc`. **The finding is unchanged and the warning is unchanged: the safe deletion is the `g_sc` driver, now `:239`, NOT the `g_dc` one, now `:309`.** TRACK STRAYROW did not fix it -- `rtl/**` was outside its ownership too, and it was told explicitly to confirm and record rather than reach. Raw measurement in `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_strayrow-gate-row-and-three-handoffs.md` section 5.7. **This is the fourth finding and the second re-measurement; the next reader should be able to act on it without re-deriving anything.** |
| **IPSYNC-DOC** | **`ip_repo/check_ip_sync.py`'s docstring now documents a defect that has been FIXED, which is the same trap TRACK FLOOR just cleared out of `tools/lmhead_window_check.py`.** Its "THE HONEST WEAKNESS" note says `hw/package_mac_axi.tcl` and `hw/package_matvec_engine.tcl` "both END IN AN ERROR, `Unknown property 'CONFIG.ASSOCIATED_BUSIF' on bus_interface`, after `ipx::save_core` has already run". TRACK FLOOR fixed both scripts 2026-08-29 and MEASURED the before and after with Vivado 2023.2 (pre-fix rc=1 and no `PACKAGE_DONE`; post-fix rc=0, `CLOCK_ASSOC: s_axi`, `PACKAGE_DONE 1`). The surrounding paragraph is still correct and worth keeping -- the checker genuinely cannot see a packaging script that is itself wrong -- so only the worked example is stale. | **OPEN, no owner. `ip_repo/**` was outside TRACK FLOOR's ownership**, so it recorded this instead of editing, which is the same call it made on AXIRD-FRST. **CLOSED 2026-08-29 by TRACK STRAYROW (`15b2f39`), exactly as FLOOR asked.** The worked example is kept in its FIXED form rather than deleted: it now states that it was first recorded by TRACK NOGUARD, that TRACK FLOOR root-caused and fixed it in `d2adbcd`, and that the MEASURED before/after was pre-fix rc=1 with no `PACKAGE_DONE` against post-fix rc=0 with `CLOCK_ASSOC: s_axi` and `PACKAGE_DONE 1`, citing `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_floor-and-three-defects.md`. The surrounding weakness paragraph is untouched. **Deleting the example would also have broken a live cross-reference in the other direction:** `hw/package_mac_axi.tcl:36` points back at this note by name. VERIFIED at HEAD rather than taken from this entry -- both packaging scripts now read the value through `ipx::get_bus_parameters` and `error "PACKAGE FAIL"` if it is not `s_axi`, and both are committed clean. MEASURED after the edit: `--selftest` `SELFTEST PASS` with `CHECK ALONE=6`, live run `IPSYNC: 3 IP(s), 32 packaged .vhd, 0 finding(s)` / `IPSYNC: PASS`. A sweep for siblings citing the same example found none: the only other live citations of `ASSOCIATED_BUSIF` outside `docs/debugging/` are the two fixed scripts themselves. |
| **STRAY-NEXTJOB** | **A reset that lands with bursts outstanding leaves `axi_rd_port` delivering the PREVIOUS job's beats as the NEXT job's, and this is now REPRODUCED rather than argued.** It is the open item in section 8 of `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_a7-dual-clock-run-gate.md`, which TRACK A7 raised and deliberately did not fix. MEASURED 2026-08-29 by TRACK STRAYROW (full write-up `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_strayrow-gate-row-and-three-handoffs.md`, control E) on the COMMITTED RTL with A7's `outst` clamp present, using `sim/tb_axi_rd_port_stray.vhd` with its `DRAIN_WAIT` cut from 200 to 4 core cycles: all three clock ratios report a value-oracle failure, `BEAT got 3133 want 5120` at `anear`, `got 3108 want 5120` at `aslow`, `got 3155 want 5120` at `afast` -- a beat from a burst issued BEFORE the reset, handed to the consumer as the new job's word 0. **The clamp does not touch this. It is a wrong-numbers failure, not a hang.** The mechanism is in `rtl/axi_rd_fsm.vhd`: after a reset `arv = '0'` and `outst = 0`, so a following `start` satisfies `S_DRAIN`'s exit condition immediately, the clear runs, and pre-reset beats then land in `S_RUN` and are written to the FIFO. On the FK33 the two reset nets genuinely differ (`core_aresetn` against the XDMA's `axi_aresetn`), so the slave keeping its queue across the port's reset is the SHIPPING case, not a bench contrivance. | **OPEN. It is a DESIGN DECISION, not a fix, and it is deliberately NOT taken by one track.** A7 section 6 sets out the fork: preserving `outst`/`arv` across `rst` so `S_DRAIN` waits for the strays is correct if the slave does NOT share the reset (the FK33 case) and HANGS if it does (the case `sim/tb_axi_rd_port_dual.vhd`'s J7 models). **Nothing says the card computed anything wrong**: it needs a reset mid-job followed by a restart inside the drain window, and the shipping flow has not been shown to produce one. The gate row is parked on the safe side at `DRAIN_WAIT = 200` so it goes in GREEN; the oracle that catches this is already in the file, so whoever takes the decision shrinks one constant and has the check. `rtl/**` was outside TRACK STRAYROW's ownership. |

### OI-3b, raised by TRACK C-SEAM 2026-08-29 -- the purest instance yet

**`sim/tb_llama_top_seq.vhd` PASSES with defect C1 fully restored** (299 s,
`OVERALL PASS 1 FAIL 0`). As a negative control -- because a PASS is otherwise
indistinguishable from a mutant that never reached the checker -- `v_ref` was
collapsed to a SINGLE register shared across every layer AND every KV head,
strictly worse than C1. **It PASSES again** (319 s).

Cause: the `R_X` landmark is `report`ed, never `assert`ed. Its actual gate is
self-consistency across KV read latencies, and **a deterministic defect is
consistent with itself.** The bench's own header already said "still PASS"
before and after C1's fix; the same fact sat in the file, unread as a gap.

MEASURED by the dispatcher, and stronger than reported: four of the six
`tb_llama_top*` benches carry NO assert at all, and `_seq` carries neither
assert nor report.

    tb_llama_top       45 asserts    tb_llama_top_seq        0
    tb_llama_top_smp   16 asserts    tb_llama_top_real       0
                                     tb_llama_top_normw      0
                                     tb_llama_top_smp_beh    0

**That is a lead, NOT a verdict**, and the distinction must be kept: `regress.sh`
judges rows TEXTUALLY via `FAIL_RE`/`PASS_RE` (`:1207`), so a bench with zero
asserts can still fail correctly by PRINTING `MISMATCH`, and one with many
asserts can still be decoration if they do not cover the value. C-SEAM's
empirical negative control is the real evidence. **TRACK OI3B owns this.**

Generalisation from C-SEAM, worth keeping: interleaving the layers is necessary
and nowhere near sufficient. Only schedule **plus an independent value oracle at
the output** kills the mutant.

### The BACKLOG table is not being maintained

Three landed rows were found still open today (1, 12, and OI-4), and one of them
caused a track to be dispatched onto finished work. The In flight section has a
rule about exactly this and the BACKLOG table has none. **Strike a row in the
same action that lands it.**

### TRACK REALSHAPE, 2026-08-29: the real shape has never elaborated, and it is the DEFAULT

`ghdl -r llama_top` with **no generic overrides** dies: 24.9 GB, 18.2 s,
`STORAGE_ERROR : grt-table.adb:58`. VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY by the dispatcher:
`mk_shape(MODEL, NCARDS)` occurs **exactly once in the whole VHDL tree**, at
`rtl/llama_top.vhd:168`, as `llama_top`'s OWN DEFAULT, commented "Defaults to
the real build target. A simulation passes `mk_shape_scaled(...)`."

**So the never-elaborated configuration is the top level's default -- the one
synthesis gets if nobody overrides it.** Every simulation ever run has passed
the scaled shape instead.

The wall is not a subsystem. `gdn_block` standalone at the exact 9B generics
takes 0.35 s / 299 MB. It is one declaration: `rtl/llama_top.vhd:2731-2733`
models B's per-layer recurrent state as a **signal** array of 201,326,592 bits.
MEASURED ~228 bytes per GHDL scalar signal, so DERIVED **~46 GB**. The same
bits as a process variable measured **206 MB / 0.17 s**.

Six defects, five invisible at `mk_shape_scaled`. The sharpest is **R4**:
`attn_kv_axi:455`'s guard `NBLK <= 16` is UNREACHABLE at the shipping
`HEAD_DIM 256`, so the illegal value prints `overflow detected` with no line
number, and at `HEAD_DIM 32/64` the same value prints the named assert. It also
makes `llama_top:3650`'s mirror guard dead. **Zero margin, hit exactly by the
shipping geometry, and one step past it the diagnostic vanishes.**

`VN_W` 14 gives only 1.33x at 9B and **fails outright at 27B** (`ffn` 17408),
which matters for the stated end goal.

**The prize:** with `stmem` shrunk in a throwaway probe, the FULL composition
including real B elaborates in **2.09 GB / 1.93 s**, so a real-shape
elaboration gate row is affordable. TRACK REALFIX is going for it.

### Raised by TRACK D-PROG, 2026-08-29 -- the most serious of the day

**Every check on the layer program was an agreement check against the schedule
itself.** Two were further transcriptions of it (`seq_tbl_pkg`,
`llama_sched_pkg`), one asked only whether a descriptor is well FORMED (the
gateware has no idea which tensor a job should have used), and the fourth
diffed a run against a run driven by the second. That column is jointly
compatible with a program that is internally perfect and computes the wrong
model, and the earlier write-up said so itself.

`tools/dprog_oracle.py` is the first check that is not: it decodes the EMITTED
BYTES against artefacts from other sources -- llama.cpp's execution order via
`tools/ref9b/seam_map.py`, the packed `manifest.json`, and decisively each
`.mv4i` file's own 4 KB header, whose sub-region offset table at `0x38` pins
every weight base exactly. On the generated program: **39,330 checks, 0 FAIL**,
whole token, 505 steps. Teeth: 25 of 27 mutations killed, including **all six
that the earlier table recorded as RTL-silent**.

**Then the same oracle was run against `--stamp sched`, byte-identical to
`sim/llama_sched_pkg.vhd`, the table `llama_top` actually executes: 2,401
FAILS.** 311 `w_exp`, 253 `out_shift`, and `nsub_w = 29` on every step, which
the FK33's A wrapper refuses with `ERR_GEOM`. Byte-identity against a walker
test proves the step SEQUENCE agrees and says nothing about the numbers a real
run needs. **TRACK SCHED-FIX confirmed the numbers and CORRECTED the framing (`78e2f5a`).**
It reproduced the dump independently, without D-PROG's tool, and byte-compared:
0 mismatches of 4,040 words, so the transcription is faithful.

**But the 2,401 is three different things and only one is a defect, and the
headline was wrong in a way that matters.** `sim/llama_sched_pkg.vhd` is NOT
"the table `llama_top` actually executes" in any shipping sense: it is
`sim/`-only, consumed solely by `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd:484`, and in no synthesis
flow. VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY by the dispatcher: `llama_top` appears nowhere
under `hw/`, and `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` wraps `matvec_int4_desc_axi`,
i.e. **subsystem A only, no D on the card today.** That is not a quibble that
shrinks the finding; it is WHY the finding was invisible.

**The real defect, fixed:** `nsub_w`/`nsub_s` were 29/4, the superseded
`ROWS_IF=58` budget, carried in under comments claiming they were "the real
ones". Right values 24/3, confirmed from an artefact no generator wrote: every
packed `.mv4i` header's own bytes (`nports_w` at `0x1A`, `n_scale_sub` at
`0x34`). All 311 A jobs would have been refused before `start` with `EC_GEOM`
(NOT `ERR_GEOM`, which does not exist) and a polling driver would hang.

**Seven independent reasons it went unnoticed**, the last being the one to
generalise: `seq_desc_fetch` only range-checks against `NSUB_MAX=64`; the base
array is not fetched yet; `llama_top:2280` binds `matvec_int4`, which has no
descriptor plane, so no `tb_llama_top*` row can contain an `EC_GEOM` check;
`tb_a_geom` restated the constants itself; `check_a_geometry.py` covered two of
four numbers; no D on the card; and **the two generators agreed with each
other.** Producer-versus-producer agreement is not evidence.

**Deliberately NOT "fixed": `w_exp`/`out_shift`.** `llama_sched_pkg` emits at an
arbitrary shape with no tensor to take a value from, and the ranges are
measured constraints. The 1,157 residual failures are the CORRECT result and
are now asserted to stay.

**OI-4 is STALE at HEAD and should be closed.** `tools/gen_layer_program.py`
(1,015 lines) landed at `a2b20f3`: job sequencing, region routing and the D
fields A does not read all exist. Backlog 6's items 1 to 3 were already done.

Two corrections worth carrying: **`token_embd.weight` needs ZERO descriptor
jobs, not 15** (host-side gather into `R_X`; the 505-step program contains no A
job on it), and "one matvec job is emitted" understates it by 310 -- **311 are
emitted and all pass**. `output.weight`'s 15 windows are confirmed.

**Trap to propagate:** `gen_layer_program.py` defaults to the PRE-QKV-PAD packed
set, where 48 of 311 A jobs are refused. **Always pass `--manifest`.**

**OI-9 preference, asked for and NOW ACTED ON:** subdivide via `ERR_INFO`. It
already carries a word index, so it costs neither a format change nor a
reserved D value. **Oren chose exactly this on 2026-08-29.** D-PROG's preference
was recorded and then sat unasked for a day, which is the deferral-becomes-a-
decision failure mode this board has its own section about.

### Raised by TRACK DESC-MUT, 2026-08-29

* **Two weakening mutations are stopped only by a declared VHDL integer range.**
  `S5` and `F3` accept a descriptor that should be refused, and the only thing
  preventing it is a range declaration, **which is a bit width in synthesis and
  not a check**. So they are caught in simulation and would NOT be caught on the
  card. Recorded as ABORT rather than counted as kills, which is the honest
  reading. No owner.
* **`EC_CORE` (0xE) is reachable by no bench in the tree.** Mutation `R1` deletes
  the `core_err -> EC_CORE` path and survives both judges. Closing it needs a
  stimulus no bench currently produces.
* **"Refused for the right reason" is recoverable for only 6 of 9 error codes**,
  and this is now MEASURED rather than suspected. `EC_DESC` (0x3) is raised at
  nine sites with two confirmed collisions even with `ERR_INFO` pinned. Not
  fixable by renumbering: `EC_SHAPE` took the last 4-bit value, which is OI-9,
  and `ERR_INFO` is a word index by construction.
* **Subsystem A coverage gaps:** `rtl/matvec_int4.vhd` and `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd`
  have no mutation script; `USE_XEXP_PORT=true` appears in NO bench at all; and
  `DUAL_CLK=true` is a manual run, so the descriptor-path CDC, whose absence
  once broke 17 of 22 cases, has no automatic coverage.

### Two blind spots recorded, with no owner

* **Gray coding has no automated defence, and TRACK BOARDAUDIT narrowed that to exactly one class.** TRACK CDC-STATIC landed real machinery (`sim/cdc_teeth.sh`, `sim/mutate_async_fifo.sh` class GRAY `G1`..`G6`, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_cdc-static-analysis.md`, `be982b3`) and it closes two of three classes: the encoder/decoder MISMATCH (`G2`) is killed by simulation, and the 2FF-vs-1FF MTBF class (`G3`/`G4`/`C6`) by `report_cdc`. **What remains undefended is `G1` alone: both gray functions replaced by identity, consistently.** It is worse than uncaught -- the binary-pointer design reports TWO FEWER `report_cdc` warnings than the correct one, so any "the report must not get worse" rule PASSES it. Vivado classifies by width, depth, ASYNC_REG and fan-in and never inspects an encoding. Simulation and static analysis are complementary on topology and **both blind to the encoding.** The CDC-STATIC write-up says this about itself in its own section 7; backlog row N10.
* **`K2b`, a standing hazard, not a task.** `P_CB_CHK`'s idle invariant watches `cbw_v(0)`, the command REGISTER, not the write. Any future change that deepens the codebook command path makes the invariant vacuous with nothing in the tree noticing. Lever C is no longer being taken (the shell routes without it), but the hazard is not specific to lever C.

## Decisions taken, with their triggers

**Why this section exists.** An independent review on 2026-08-29 named
"decisions deferred so long they have quietly become decisions" as a failure
mode of this project. A deferral with no recorded trigger is indistinguishable
from having forgotten. Each row below says what was decided, by whom, on what
evidence, and **what event should reopen it**.

| decision | by | on what evidence | trigger to revisit |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**Congestion fallback is lever C (IQ4_NL codebook to LUTRAM)**, pre-authorised.~~ **TRIGGER FIRED, DECISION CLOSED AS NOT NEEDED.** | Oren, 2026-08-29; closed by TRACK BOARDAUDIT 2026-08-29 | CONGEST measured the codebook at 86,992 primitives, 39.5% of `matvec_core`, and 97.7%/98.8% of the design's MUXF7/MUXF8. ~7.1x win, zero throughput cost. Risk is a 32x write-coherency surface. | **The stated trigger was "if TRACK PBLOCK routes the design, the fallback is not needed", and PBLOCK routed it at `ed1ffe2`** (0 nets with routing errors, 288,506 fully routed). Lever C was not taken and its 32x write-coherency surface was never opened. The row stayed live for a day after the event that retired it. Reopen only if a LATER build fails to route; the pre-authorisation stands, and the standing condition still holds -- **if lever C is ever taken, its oracle work is dispatched ALONGSIDE, not after.** Note `K2b` in the blind-spot list is a hazard in this same code and is NOT specific to lever C, so it does not close with this row. |

### LEVER C REOPENED 2026-08-30 -- its own stated trigger has fired

The row says **"Reopen only if a LATER build fails to route; the
pre-authorisation stands."** A later build is failing to route. No new decision
from Oren is needed; this records that the condition was met.

**The closure reasoning was evaluated against the wrong design, and that is
worth naming as a defect in the decision log rather than in the RTL.** The
stated trigger was "if TRACK PBLOCK routes the design, the fallback is not
needed", and PBLOCK routed `ed1ffe2` cleanly. But **PBLOCK routed the
subsystem-A-only shell.** The design that has to fit is A+B+C+D, which did not
exist in routable form on 2026-08-29. A trigger discharged against a smaller
design than the one it was protecting is the same shape as the guards-that-pass-
for-the-wrong-reason class in CLAUDE.md.

**MEASURED by TRACK TIMING, 2026-08-30**, from COMPOSE4's surviving placed
checkpoint plus its own runs:

- Placed CLB occupancy **54,866 of 54,960 = 99.83%**, congestion level 7.
- **33,767 failing endpoints after placement**, not the 256 the post-synthesis
  report shows. Of the 20,000 worst, **20,000 of 20,000 are net-dominated**:
  mean net delay **4.575 ns** against mean logic delay **0.670 ns**.
- Attribution control: **subsystem A alone fails 3,779 endpoints** while being
  byte-for-byte the entity that closes 200 MHz on the card today. It cannot
  have acquired a logic problem by being placed beside B, C and D.
- WNS after `phys_opt_design` **-2.834 ns** (from -3.056).

**The fit arithmetic, which is the real answer to N3:**

```
composed 346,971 + shell 40,326 + norm image 32,943 = 420,240 LUT
raw LUT:  420,240 / 439,680 = 95.6%          <- looks survivable, and is not the constraint
at the MEASURED 6.32 LUT/CLB -> 66,494 CLB of 54,960 = 121%
at 7.0                        -> 60,034 CLB           = 109%
at an unreachable 8.0         -> 52,530 CLB           =  96%
```

**The binding constraint is CLB packing density, not LUT count.** That is
exactly why lever C is more valuable than its LUT saving suggests: CONGEST
MEASURED the codebook at 86,992 primitives, 39.5% of `matvec_core`, and
**97.7% / 98.8% of the whole design's MUXF7 / MUXF8**. MUXF7/F8 pin LUTs into
specific CLB slots, so removing them attacks the 6.32 directly. **Do not
justify lever C on its ~7.1x LUT win alone; the packing effect is the point and
it has not been measured.**

**CORRECTION 2026-08-30, from TRACK LEVERC (`845ea28`): the MUXF7/F8 figures
above are the A-ONLY SHELL build's, and this block applied them to the COMPOSED
fit. That is the same defect this block was written to record, committed inside
it.**

MEASURED in the composed A+B+C+D, from TRACK TIMING's own `TT_MUX` census: the
codebook is **37.7% of MUXF7 (24,576 / 65,108) and 47.6% of MUXF8
(12,288 / 25,788)** -- not 97.7% / 98.8%. `d_norm/gvr.u_rms` alone carries
17,696 F7 and 8,736 F8, and `c_attn/u_arr` another 15,796 F7. **Attribution corrected the same day:** I wrote here that TIMING had made the
same substitution in its section 7a. **It had not, and that accusation is
withdrawn.** TIMING applied 97.7% / 98.8% to `a_eng`'s OWN census, explicitly
labelled as such, giving 24,297 MUXF7 against LEVERC's structural
**24,576 = 1536 x 16** -- 1.1% agreement, and as a share of the composed design
its figure reads 37.3% / 47.5%, the same quantity. **The substitution was mine
alone.** I inferred a second instance from a superficial reading and published
it as a finding about another track's work.

**A second correction, which reverses the sign of the argument.** This block
said removing MUXF7/F8 "attacks the 6.32 directly" because they pin LUTs into
CLB slots. LEVERC's arithmetic says the premise is backwards: **a MUXF8 shape
occupies 4 LUT6 in one CLB half and wastes none of them, so a paired mux region
sits at exactly 8.00 LUT/CLB -- the device maximum.** The codebook mux is the
DENSEST structure in the design, not the loosest, and removing it LOWERS the
average density. An indivisible shape costs the placer freedom, not LUT sites.

Bounded rather than point-estimated, since the non-mux logic also cannot exceed
8 LUT/CLB (which refutes the fully-unpaired extreme by arithmetic):

```
mux-region density        4.69 .. 8.00 LUT/CLB
CLB saving from lever C   3,072 .. 8,946
overshoot (11,534 CLB)    27% .. 78% closed
post-lever-C occupancy    104.7% .. 115.4%
density moves             6.05 (down) .. 6.66 (up)   from 6.324
```

**Lever C alone does not close the fit under either bound.** That agrees with
TIMING's conclusion while removing the reasoning both of us used to reach it.

**`K2b` is CLOSED** by the same track, independently of whether lever C ships.
`P_CB_CHK` watched the command register; re-aiming it at "the last stage" does
not fix it, because the next change moves past that too. The new `P_CB_MODEL`
watches no register at all: it rebuilds the write path from the entity's ports,
delays it by a declared `CB_WR_LAT`, and requires `cb` to equal it every copy
every cycle. **Its attribution control denied credit for thirteen of fifteen
apparent detections** -- without it the table would have claimed fifteen where
two are real.

Standing condition carried forward from the original row and still binding:
**if lever C is taken, its oracle work is dispatched ALONGSIDE, not after.**
Its known risk is a 32x write-coherency surface. `K2b` remains a standing
hazard in this same code and is not specific to lever C.
| **Tandem PCIe, ALL OF IT: deferred until 9B inference works on the card.** Not just the Field Updates hierarchy question -- the whole subject, including MCAP and ICAP. Do NOT restructure the shell for it, and do NOT spend a slot on it. | Oren, 2026-08-29 (superseding his earlier 'decide after it routes') | The earlier deferral was already the right call on TANDEM's own evidence (`abbd2ed`): its stage-1 pblock excludes `SLICE_X216Y0:SLICE_X232Y239` at DRC severity **Error**, **50,135 placed cells sit inside it**, and there is nothing to the right of `SLICE_X232` so every one of them moves LEFT into the half that already fails to route. Oren has now widened it: a bitstream-reload path is worth nothing until there is a bitstream worth reloading. | **9B inference running on the card.** Not 'the design routes' -- routing is necessary and nowhere near sufficient. Until then the standing procedure is the warm JTAG configure into a live root port plus `echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan`, which WORKS and is documented in `docs/debugging/2026-08-28_fk33-first-light.md`. **Nobody should re-litigate the reload path before then.** Accepted costs, both real: retrofitting the three-partition hierarchy later is the expensive path, and the card still cannot configure itself at power-on. |
| **Logits egress is the full writeback, NOT on-card top-k.** Not a judgement call in the end. | evidence, confirmed by dispatcher 2026-08-29 | EGRESS measured writeback at 124 us, **0.32% of the 38.27 ms budget** and 32x oversupplied vs the 300 MB/s A can produce logits at, on two already-reserved idle pseudo-channels. The fabric direction is INVERTED from the intuition: top-k's logic lands inside `matvec_core`, which is 72-81% of every level-6/7 congestion window, while the writeback lands at the die edge. Top-k also loses repetition/frequency penalties, `logit_bias` outside k, speculative verification, and the oracle at the seam that decides a token, and makes `top_p` an approximation whose error the host CANNOT DETECT. | If the writeback is ever measured to add materially to `matvec_core`'s congestion. Two unexplored options are recorded in `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_logits-egress.md`: top-k plus the exact normaliser, and C2H from the existing 43-BRAM36 result buffer. |
| **Card 2's factory flash: DUMP IT, and this is NOT a Tandem question.** It was previously bundled into the Tandem trigger and should not have been. | dispatcher, 2026-08-29 | Card 1's SQRL factory image was **destroyed** by an agent crossing the hardware boundary. Card 2's copy is the ONLY surviving one and is card 1's restore path. That value is independent of Tandem, of routing, and of inference. `hw/fk33/flash.sh` already has a readback mode; it writes nothing, but note its own warning that **readback IS itself a JTAG configuration**, so the card stops running the factory image until a power cycle. Check VCCINT is above the 0.698 V floor first, and treat an all-0xFF or all-0x00 readback as a **failed read that looks like a backup**. | **DONE 2026-08-29, and this row did not say so.** `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_second-fk33-verify-and-flash-backup.md`: card 2 self-configured from its own SPI flash (`CFG_DONE 1`, every BOOT_STATUS error bit clear) and the flash was read out to `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_factory_backup_153300001366.{bin,mcs}`. **Teeth on the readback: it was read TWICE and the two reads are md5-identical (`dcb97432538b9c7d2855b1d9c93658f7`)**, which is the check that separates a real backup from an all-0xFF read that looks like one. Two findings came free: **the SQRL factory image does NOT raise VCCINT** (card 2 measured 0.677 V running it, never observable before because card 1's image was destroyed), and `jtag.sh` was resetting the WRONG CARD's FTDI regardless of `FK33_TARGET`, now fixed. **What is NOT done: the backup has no off-disk copy.** It is untracked in git and sits only on a root filesystem at 91%. That is backlog row N9 and it is trivial. |
| **OI-9, the full descriptor error-code space: SUBDIVIDE VIA `ERR_INFO`.** Not widening the code field, and not raiding a value reserved for subsystem D. | Oren, 2026-08-29 | It keeps the descriptor's byte layout UNCHANGED, so nothing already byte-pinned in `docs/2026-08-28_matvec-descriptor-format.md` moves -- and that format is the one artefact subsystem A, subsystem D and the host builder all read, and the one that has already been verified. `ERR_INFO` already carries a word index, so the sub-case rides in a field that exists. Accepted costs, both real: **`ERR_INFO` stops being free for anything else**, and the host decoder gains a second lookup. | `ERR_INFO` being needed for a second purpose, or the sub-case count outgrowing that field too. **This is no longer a decision and backlog row 10 is struck**; it becomes a dispatchable implementation item owning `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd`, `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd`, the host decoder in `server/pl_backend.c` and `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`. |
| **B-CONV-HIST: CLOSED AS WON'T-FIX.** `B_SRC_REAL` is not wanted, so the causal conv does not get a real history and the `(KCONV-1) x qkv_dim` buffer is not built. | Oren, 2026-08-29 | `B_SRC_REAL` is **already unrunnable for a separate `R_ALPHA` reason**, recorded in `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s own header: with it TRUE the degenerate-residual count RISES, 0/3/10/23 -> 3/5/11/24 at 4/8/16/32 blocks, because A's synthetic weights make `R_ALPHA`'s VALUES physically impossible and `gdn_scalar`'s gate saturates shut. So nothing regresses by leaving this. The buffer BTOP1 refused would have been an ESTIMATE ~90 MB of GHDL signal at the 9B shape, in the file TRACK REALFIX had just fought a 46 GB signal down to make elaborate at all. | **THE TWO REFUSALS ARE THE GUARD AND MUST NOT BE REMOVED AS DEAD CODE BY A LATER CLEANUP.** `S_GO` asserts and `tools/gdn_oracle.py` raises, independently, on the zero-mantissa-at-a-real-exponent value; that is why this closes as won't-fix rather than as a latent defect. Deleting either refusal because "`B_SRC_REAL` is never true" is precisely how a won't-fix becomes a silent defect. **Reopen only if `B_SRC_REAL` is wanted, and note that is TWO problems, not one: `R_ALPHA` has to be fixed first.** |
| **Hardware, overnight 2026-08-29: OREN PERSONALLY may JTAG-configure card 1 and run host-side tests.** | Oren, 2026-08-29 | Backlog row N1 cannot be answered without it: the bitstream is loaded, the weights are resident, and no arithmetic has ever been checked on this silicon. | **THIS CHANGES NOTHING FOR AGENTS. The no-hardware rule for every track is absolute and unchanged.** Scope, and it is narrow: JTAG configure of **card 1** and host-side tests, by Oren, **scoped to the night of 2026-08-29 and not a permanent grant**. NOT authorised, by anyone: any VCCINT change (stay at wiper 68, ~0.717 V), any flash write, anything touching **card 2**, and any subagent doing any of it for any reason. Card 2's factory image is the only surviving SQRL factory image in existence and is card 1's restore path. |
| **`C_MAXPOS` = 131,072 for the 9B bitstream**, not the 233,396 the resized arenas allow. | Oren, 2026-08-29 | KVSIZE's resize took the arenas from 61,229 to 233,396 tokens, so both values fit and the choice was never a derivation -- TRACK CGENERICS said so explicitly and set neither. 131,072 is Qwen3.5-9B's own native context; everything past it depends on RoPE extension work that does not exist, so the extra 102,324 tokens would be capacity the weights cannot use. Costs ~44% of the arena as headroom. | RoPE scaling landing, or an arena needing the space back. Note `C_KV_ADDR_W = 33` is NOT freed by this: CGENERICS measured it exact with **zero slack** at the chunk-domain sum, and only a value SMALLER than 131,072 would change it. |
| **Cross-stack read measurement on the card: NOT taken.** Needs hardware; raised with Oren and never confirmed. | pending | 12 of 27 masters read cross-stack; a stack offers at most 15 engine ports. | **PREMISE FALSIFIED 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT.** The stated reason for deprioritising was "the design does not route, so there is no engine bitstream to measure with". **The design routes (`ed1ffe2`) and the engine bitstream has been loaded on card 1**, links Gen3 x4, and both HBM stacks round-trip through the host BAR at 0.51 GB/s write / 0.78 GB/s read. So the blocker is now only the hardware boundary and Oren's time, not the absence of a bitstream. It is still not urgent -- it should follow N1, because measuring the bandwidth of an engine that has never been shown to compute anything is the wrong order. |


## Open issues

### OI-1: RESOLVED 2026-08-28 -- descriptor in memory

A is bit-exact at the FK33 geometry and the HBM can serve its 27 masters
(30 already measured at 288.0 GB/s, 100% of ceiling). Three things stand
between that and arithmetic on silicon, and the first is a decision:

1. **The register map.** `rtl/matvec_int4_axi.vhd:252,265` asserts
   `NPORTS_W=4 / NPORTS_S=1` and holds four `W_BASE`/`W_BASE_HI` pairs plus one
   `S_BASE` pair. FK33 needs 24+3. Its own header argues the map must NOT grow
   with a generic, on the grounds that it would be "a map no driver could
   parse". So this is a fork, not an edit.
2. **The HBM-to-core CDC does not exist.** `weight_streamer` is single-clock.
   At ACLK = f_core the duty is exactly 100% with zero margin, so the CDC is
   mandatory.
3. **`axi_rd_port`'s `MAXOUT` defaults to 2** (32 outstanding beats); the
   measured 288 GB/s run used 16.

Items 2 and 3 are determined work. **Item 1 was Oren's call and is now
answered: descriptor in memory.** All three landed 2026-08-28 as TRACK A-CTRL
above. This issue is closed; the record is kept because the rejected options
and their costs are the part worth re-reading.

**Two gaps opened by that work, both MEASURED by
`sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`'s mutation table, both deliberately NOT closed:**

- **A well-formed base pointing at the WRONG sub-region is undetectable.**
  Case 19 aims weight sub-region 7's base at sub-region 8's bytes. The design
  accepts, computes and reports success, and 4 of 100 result elements are wrong
  -- exactly the two rows that bit slice 7 carries, in each of the two live
  tiles. Nothing in the descriptor says what a sub-region should CONTAIN, so
  only the weight store's own hash can catch this. Same family as OI-3.
- **A `w_beats` that is too small HANGS.** Case 20 halves it; the array starves
  and the job never completes and never errors, because `WDOG_LIMIT` covers the
  descriptor FETCH only. Not a wrong answer, but a driver polling for
  `done or err` waits forever. Closing it needs a compute-phase watchdog whose
  limit is a per-geometry number, which is a decision rather than an
  implementation, so it was left for Oren.

### OI-2: `attn_emit.vhd:400` is a bound violation at `NGRP = 1` (latent)

**RESOLVED at HEAD, 2026-08-29.** `rtl/attn_emit.vhd` no longer assigns
`grp <= 1` anywhere; `:410` is now a comment documenting the old defect, and
the `NGRP = 1` case takes an explicit `grp <= 0; state <= S_SHIFTS`. VERIFIED
by reading the file at HEAD, not by trusting this entry. The description below
is kept for the record and is no longer the state of the tree.


`grp` is declared `integer range 0 to NGRP-1` (`:263`) and line 400 assigns
`grp <= 1` unconditionally. `NGRP` is `positive`, so `NGRP = 1` (one KV head)
is a legal generic value that is an immediate bound violation. Default is 2,
so nothing hits it today. Found by the integration track, verified directly,
deliberately not fixed.

### OI-3: the bench cannot see two classes of defect

Of nine mutations on the integration bench, **two pass while broken**: an
exponent claim re-aimed at R_X, and the prefetch consuming at k-3. Both change
every element and no property in the bench can observe either. Fourth and fifth
instance of the same family. This is the honest ceiling on what `tb_llama_top`
proves, and it is not closed by any track above.

**UPDATE 2026-08-29, TRACK BOARDAUDIT. Probably closed, and NOT MEASURED, which
is the whole point of saying so.** TRACK OI3B (`5578132`) gave the family a real
value gate: `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`'s `P14` fires when
`results(0)(NTOK-1)(0) /= L_X0`, with `L_X0` pinned in `sim/tb_llama_top_real.vhd`.
The two defects OI-3 names are `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s
`c_exp_region <= to_unsigned(R_VIN, 8)` and `if k >= 2 then qg_buf(k-2) <= el_rdata`,
both live in the config `tb_llama_top_real` exercises, and both move `R_X(0)`.
So the gate ought to kill them.

**But nothing has shown that it does.** MEASURED: no `sim/mutate_llama_top_*.sh`
row and no line of OI3B's own teeth table names either mutation; OI3B's teeth
were taken on defect C1, the `v_ref` collapse and the `gdn_silu` truncation.
**A gate that ought to catch a defect and has never been shown to is exactly the
class this project keeps being bitten by**, so this stays OPEN as backlog row N6
until two mutations have been run. It is cheap: two mutations, one bench.

### OI-5: RESOLVED 2026-08-28 (`c8a57d8`) -- the Python decoder was wrong on 243 ids

Found by TRACK TOK-C while verifying the C port, and deliberately NOT fixed
there. `tools/extract_tokenizer.py`'s `TOKEN_TYPE` table has `5: BYTE,
6: UNUSED`; llama.cpp has it the other way round (`5 = UNUSED`, `6 = BYTE`).
The 243 tokens with `token_type == 5` are ids 248,077..248,319, text
`[PAD248077]`..`[PAD248319]` -- vocabulary padding, not byte-map characters.
llama.cpp decodes them to the **empty string**;
`qwen35_tokenizer.py::piece_bytes` returns their literal text. MEASURED against
the oracle: 243 of 248,320 ids mismatch.

Unreachable from `encode`, so every corpus number in
`docs/debugging/2026-08-28_qwen35-tokenizer.md` stands. Reachable from a
sampler, so a server using the Python would emit text llama.cpp does not.
`server/qwen35_tok.c` is correct. The fix is one line in `piece_bytes` plus the
label swap in `extract_tokenizer.py`, but it needs a re-run of that file's
numbers, so it is an issue rather than a drive-by edit. This also withdraws
that file's claim that "13 byte-mapped characters carry NORMAL type": this
vocabulary has ZERO tokens of type BYTE. Write-up:
`docs/debugging/2026-08-28_qwen35-tokenizer-c.md` section 8.1.

**RESOLVED, `c8a57d8`.** The label swap and the decoder case are both fixed,
but the part worth keeping is the third change. **No corpus of any size could
ever have caught this**, because UNUSED tokens are unreachable from `encode`,
so the only ids the corpus can decode are the ids encoding produced. The
Python's verifier had no way to look anywhere else, which is why the C found it
and the Python did not, despite the Python having been checked over 53,411
strings AND a 1.1M-codepoint sweep. Coverage of the input space is not coverage
of the output space.

So `tools/verify_tokenizer.py` gained `--all-ids`, decoding every id in the
vocabulary one per string against the oracle -- the check the C's verifier had
and the Python's lacked. MEASURED after the fix: 248,320 ids, 0 mismatches,
corpus still 0/0. Teeth-checked by removing the fix again: 243 mismatches,
every one a `[PAD*]` token with `type=5`.

**Generalise this before the next tokenizer-shaped thing:** when a check is
driven by generated inputs, ask what part of the output space those inputs
cannot reach, and enumerate it separately.

### OI-7: `l2norm_rs` rejects a legal input, at `severity failure`

**RESOLVED at HEAD, 2026-08-29.** `rtl/l2norm_rs.vhd:256` now states the bound
INCLUSIVELY (`ssq <= shift_left(...)`), matching `:97`. Fixed by RANGE rather
than by widening `SSQ_BITS`, which would have admitted up to `2^38-1` and
thrown away half the overflow detection. VERIFIED at HEAD.


Found by TRACK B-ACCURACY and deliberately not fixed, because `l2norm_rs` sits
under `gdn_block` and `llama_top` as of `3246046`.

`rtl/l2norm_rs.vhd:97` states the bound INCLUSIVELY: `ssq <= N * 2^30`, i.e.
`2^37` at `N = 128`. `:245` asserts it STRICTLY: `ssq < 2^SSQ_BITS` with
`SSQ_BITS = 30 + LOG2N = 37` (`:128`). The vector `x[i] = -32768` for all `i`
is a legal int16 input whose `ssq` is exactly `128 * 2^30 = 2^37`, so the
maximum legal input trips the assert. MEASURED on untouched RTL:

    rtl/l2norm_rs.vhd:245: (assertion failure):
        l2norm_rs: ssq outside the u37 bound implied by N

`severity failure`, so it kills the run rather than saturating.

**Corroboration the finder did not cite:** `:90` calls this "the u38 bound",
and representing `2^37` inclusively does require 38 bits, while the constant
computes 37. The author's comment disagrees with the author's constant, which
is what an off-by-one looks like from the outside. Fix is `SSQ_BITS = 31 +
LOG2N`, or make the compare `<=`.

**Not determined: whether `ssq = 2^37` is reachable from `gdn_block`'s real
activations.** Spec 2.1.3's requantizer argues against it. That is an argument,
not a measurement, and the distinction is the whole issue: an unreachable
defect is a latent trap, a reachable one is a crash. `msb(ssq) = 37` is also
the single exponent the new 182-case sweep cannot reach, so adding it to the
vector set would turn the regression red, which is not the same thing as
reporting the defect. The generator carries it as a comment naming the
measurement.

### OI-8: `matvec_core` reads `ybuf` one past the end at the top of its row range

**RESOLVED at HEAD, 2026-08-29** (`7ccc239`). `rtl/matvec_core.vhd:928` reads
`ybuf(ybuf_addr(rd_t))` through the clamping function at `:128`, which bounds
the ADDRESS rather than gating the read, so the BRAM read port still infers.
The same buffer's WRITE side was a separate defect, OI-10, fixed at `:865`.
VERIFIED at HEAD.


Found by TRACK A-SHAPE while sweeping legal shapes, and not fixed because
`rtl/matvec_core.vhd` is not that track's file.

`ybuf` is declared `array(0 to TILES-1)` (`:191`), `rd_t` is an
**unconstrained** integer (`:389`) that `S_EMIT` advances to `tiles_r`
(`:883-884`), and `:835` reads `ybuf(rd_t)` **unconditionally every cycle**.
So whenever `ceil(n_rows / ROWS_IF) = TILES` -- that is, whenever `n_rows`
falls in the top `ROWS_IF` rows of the declared `MAXROWS_BFP` range -- the last
emit cycle indexes one past the array. Verified here by inspection of all three
lines.

MEASURED by the finder at `MAXROWS_BFP=192 / ROWS_IF=48`: `n_rows = 145` and
`n_rows = 192` each abort with
`index (4) out of bounds (0 to 3) at rtl/matvec_core.vhd:835`.

**Synthesis-benign, simulation-fatal**, the same shape as OI-7: `rd_v` is `'0'`
that cycle so nothing consumes `ybuf_q`, but GHDL kills the run. **It bites
hardest for exactly the build you would want to ship**: one that sets
`MAXROWS_BFP` to the precise `n_rows` it needs in order to save BRAM, because
then every job trips it.

Consequence for the shape check that found it: A-SHAPE's sweep deliberately
stays below the trap, so **the top corner of the row range is unverified**, and
that is precisely where an off-by-one in `tiles` would show. Closing OI-8
unblocks that verification too.

### OI-10: RESOLVED 2026-08-29 (`0ff6828`) -- `matvec_core` wrote `ybuf` past the end in raw mode

Filed by TRACK RANGE, reproduced and fixed by TRACK OUTMODE. Write-up:
`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_out_mode-raw-oracle-and-oi10.md`.

Reproduced exactly as filed. `ybuf(re2_t)` was written whenever `out_mode /=
"10"`, while `S_IDLE` bounds `n_rows` against `MAXROWS_BFP` only when
`out_mode = "00"` -- and spec 7.6 makes `n_rows > MAXROWS_BFP` **legal** in raw
("in raw mode `M` may exceed `MAXROWS_BFP`", `lm_head` being the caller).
MEASURED at `MAXROWS_BFP = 64 / ROWS_IF = 4`, `out_mode = "01"`, `n_rows = 65`:
`index (16) out of bounds (0 to 15) at rtl/matvec_core.vhd:839`, with the SAME
65 rows in partial mode passing in the pass immediately before it.

**Two corrections to the filing, both worth carrying.**

1. **It is NOT reachable "on exactly the argument that produced OI-8".** That
   argument is `n_rows` in the top `ROWS_IF` rows *of* the range, and raw mode
   at exactly `MAXROWS_BFP` passes on unfixed RTL (measured). The write pointer
   stops at `tiles - 1`; only OI-8's read pointer runs one past. OI-10 needs
   `n_rows` **above** the range. Do not look for it at the top corner.
2. **`out_mode = "10"` was NOT unexercised.** `sim/tb_matvec_core` PASS 2 has
   been running partial and comparing `y_data` against the reference's `ACC`
   line all along. `out_mode = "01"` was driven, too, by
   `sim/tb_matvec_cb_lockstep` -- but that bench compares four runs **against
   each other** at one tile and never against `ref/matvec_int4.c`, so raw had
   no oracle. "Never run" was wrong; "never checked against the reference" was
   right, and it is the half that mattered.

Fixed by narrowing the write ENABLE to `out_mode = "00"`, not by clamping the
address as OI-8 did: OI-8 clamped because that access is a READ that must stay
unconditional to infer the BRAM read port, while this is a WRITE whose
condition already IS the write enable. `ybuf` is the BFP output buffer and
nothing else, so the raw write was dead as well as out of range.

`sim/tb_matvec_core` now drives all three modes against the reference and needed
no new vector -- `ref/matvec_int4.c` already writes the `YDATA` line and that IS
the raw payload; the loader was dropping it. 343 output values compared, up from
24. Six mutations; the one that does NOT bite is the alternative address-clamp
fix, which is the bench's permanent resolution floor here because nothing reads
`ybuf` in raw mode at all.

### OI-11: WITHDRAWN for the FK33 arm, RESOLVED 2026-08-29 for the AXU3EG arm

Filed by TRACK RANGE against `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`; examined by TRACK
OUTMODE.

**The FK33 arm does not have this defect and did not have it when the issue was
written.** Its `k = 0` branch is `if st(2) = '1' ... elsif st(0) /= '1' then
"is LEGAL and never completed (timeout N)"`, so a hang exits the bounded poll
with both bits clear and is scored as a failure. `git log -S"is LEGAL and never
completed"` puts that line in `f693faf`, which predates `7ccc239`, the commit
under which OI-11 was filed. Withdrawn for that arm.

**The gap is real on the AXU3EG arm**, which the filing did not name. That arm
ties off the weight masters, so an accepted descriptor can never complete by
construction and there is no `done` to poll; its verdict was `err` alone after a
fixed window. A design that silently did nothing -- never started, never errored
-- scored as an acceptance.

Closed by requiring the accepted descriptor to be RUNNING: STATUS bit 1 (`busy`)
set and bit 0 (`done`) clear after the window. That is the only completion-class
statement available where completion cannot happen. TEETH, MEASURED: an RTL
mutant that never raises `busy` on the accepted path passes the ENTIRE bench at
HEAD -- both shape sweeps, all 22 cases, `GHDL_EXIT=0` -- and fails 9 of 9 legal
AXU3EG shapes with the check in place. Nothing else in the tree saw it.

### OI-9: DECIDED 2026-08-29 -- the error-code space is full, and it gets subdivided

**Oren's decision, 2026-08-29: SUBDIVIDE VIA `ERR_INFO`.** Not widening the
4-bit field, and not raiding a value reserved for subsystem D. The reason is
that it leaves the descriptor's byte layout UNCHANGED, and that layout is the
one artefact A, D and the host builder all read and the one already verified.
Accepted cost: `ERR_INFO` stops being free for anything else, and the host
decoder gains a second lookup. Implementation is backlog row N12, and it must
carry DESC-MUT's measurement that **`EC_DESC` (0x3) is raised at NINE sites with
two confirmed collisions even with `ERR_INFO` pinned** -- subdividing `EC_DESC`
is the first thing this route buys. The statement of the problem follows and is
unchanged.

`EC_SHAPE = 0xF` (`rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd:52-57`) took the last free
value. `0x0, 0x3, 0x4, 0x9..0xE` were already taken and `0x1, 0x2, 0x5..0x8`
stay reserved for subsystem D, whose header this format shares verbatim. The
field is 4 bits and it is now full.

Not urgent, and deliberately not pre-solved: the next error condition anyone
wants to report has nowhere to go, and the options (widen the field, subdivide
a code using `ERR_INFO`, or take a reserved D value) all have consequences for
D. Whoever needs the next code decides. Recorded now so that decision is not
discovered at the worst moment. **Superseded by the decision above.**

### OI-6: llama.cpp aborts on some malformed UTF-8 (upstream, informational)

`unicode_cpt_from_utf8` masks a 4-byte UTF-8 lead with `0x07` and applies no
upper bound, so the bytes `F4 BF BF BF` decode to U+13FFFF;
`unicode_cpt_to_utf8` then throws `std::invalid_argument` and nothing between
there and `llama_tokenize` catches it. The process dies with SIGABRT.
Reproduced against `llama.cpp.upstream@1692f9e5`. Only reachable from a host
that feeds raw bytes; a JSON parser rejects them first. Recorded so nobody
re-derives it while fuzzing, and because it is why the byte fuzz excludes lead
bytes `0xF0..0xFF` -- there is no oracle answer to compare against.

### OI-12: RESOLVED 2026-08-29 (`ed1ffe2`) -- the FK33 shell build did not route

**CLOSED by TRACK BOARDAUDIT 2026-08-29, against the tree rather than against a
document.** The cause was never area, timing or the placer: it was
`hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc:138-145`, an **inherited SQRL constraint** assigning
the whole block design to a pblock holding 67% of the assigned LUTs and 33% of
the assigned DSPs. It is `IS_SOFT`, so the placer crammed and spilled rather
than failing, and SHELL's own `runme.log` said so in nine `Place 30-640` lines
nobody read. Deleting it plus a small pblock at `CLOCKREGION_X0Y0:X6Y3` routes.

VERIFIED in the tree, not in a report: `hw/fk33/results/pblock_2026-08-29/ASX_route_status.rpt`
says **0 nets with routing errors, 288,506 fully routed**, and
`hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep_eng.bit` is 22,568,402 bytes. `ed1ffe2` is an ancestor
of HEAD. The bitstream has since been loaded on card 1 and configures, links
Gen3 x4 and identifies (`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_first-engine-load-on-card.md`).

**This entry sat unmodified for a day saying "There is no routed checkpoint and
no bitstream" while both existed**, and the BACKLOG row for the same work said
the opposite. Two places recording one fact is how that happens. The
description below is kept for the record and is no longer the state of the tree.

**PROVENANCE CORRECTED 2026-08-30 by TRACK BITPREP** (`e0e4fec`,
`docs/debugging/2026-08-30_bitprep-rebuild-readiness.md`). `ed1ffe2` is the
right commit for the **constraints and the routing** and the wrong one for the
**netlist**. MEASURED from the artefact's own header: `write_bitstream` stamped
`fk33_pcieep_eng.bit` at **2026/08/29 14:38:06**, and `ed1ffe2` landed at
**14:42:42, four minutes later**. The netlist was synthesised around 06:56 that
morning from `rtl/` at **`54b3c1a`**, with `hw/fk33/` in the state committed as
`928ad9f`. No git SHA is stamped in the bitstream (`UserID=0XFFFFFFFF`), so
this is reconstructed from build logs, not read off the artefact. Several
write-ups say `ed1ffe2`; they are **not** being edited, because most of them
are talking about the routing, where it is correct. When the question is *what
RTL is on the card*, the answer is `54b3c1a`.

**What a rebuild is actually worth, MEASURED by BITPREP.** The pcieep build
consumes **fifteen** RTL files and B, C and D are not among them. `54b3c1a..HEAD`
has 28 `rtl/` commits and **only 8 touch this design**, of which one is
assert-only and one is inert at this geometry. The real content of a rebuild is
**four commits: `0ff6828`, `75f95a8` (A7's `outst` clamp), `3ecc729` (DONE1's
`done_l` race), `a4a564c` (THERMFIX's thermal guard)** -- not twenty-eight. All
four confirmed absent from the loaded bit.

**`hw/fk33/bit/` is gitignored (`.gitignore:134`), so the tree held the ONLY
copy of what is on the card.** Archived 2026-08-30 to
`/mnt/storage/fk33-bitstream-archive/`, all six `.bit` files, with the loaded
one named `fk33_pcieep_eng.2026-08-29T1438.rtl-54b3c1a.bit`. Its sha256 is
`6b12b3c46ee26396bcbc1f75cf240fe6231528a7a10c95ac91596b52bce164c6` and it was
verified equal to the working copy after the archive. **This is the rollback
artefact.** Note `hw/fk33/pcieep.sh` prefers `bit/fk33_pcieep.bit`, which is the
Aug-27 **pre-engine** build -- without `EP_BIT` set explicitly it will configure
a card with no engine and report success.


### OI-12, superseded text

**MEASURED 2026-08-29, `928ad9f`.** The first build carrying subsystem A on the
card's HBM ports places, but `route_design` terminates:

    ERROR: [Route 35-3] Design is not routable as its global congestion
                        level is 7.

7 is the top of the scale. Six attempts at initial net routing over 7 min 48 s,
then abandoned. **There is no routed checkpoint and no bitstream.**

**It is not area.** Whole design 39.50% LUT, 14.22% FF, 38.91% BRAM36, 55.03%
DSP, 0 URAM. The engine's own area in the shell is within 1.8% of the
out-of-context figure on every line (LUT 132,113 vs 134,534; FF 63,797 vs
64,067; DSP and BRAM36 identical), so the OOC numbers were honest and the
shell costs 41,581 LUT and 69 BRAM36 on top.

**It is probably not timing either, though that is not settled.** Design-wide
WNS went -0.763 after place, -0.368 after phys_opt, -0.260 at the router's last
update before it quit, against 250 MHz on the HBM AXI side and 200 MHz on the
core.

**What is NOT known is what is congested.** `report_design_analysis
-congestion` did not complete in the time available, so the 128x128
long-congestion regions south and east are the only localisation there is. The
untried experiments, in order of cheapness: a pblock putting the engine in the
clock regions nearest the HBM BLI interfaces (its core clock currently spans
all 8x4 regions); a lower clock, which separates congestion from the
timing-driven replication that added 185 of the design's 3,887 control sets;
and a different placer directive.

Write-up, including five things measured and rejected:
`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_fk33-shell-integration-does-not-route.md`.

### OI-13: the aux domain's CDC check does not scale to subsystem A

The impl-stage verification that made the aux domain trustworthy -- enumerate
every path crossing the clock boundary and demand that none is ANALYSED, since
an asynchronous group excludes a path without stopping it being enumerated --
**does not terminate** on a design containing subsystem A. MEASURED: over 20
minutes on `get_timing_paths -from <core> -to <axi> -max_paths 8`, killed.
`report_timing_summary` on the same checkpoint likewise. 28 gray-pointer FIFOs
plus 28 four-phase clear handshakes is an enormous enumeration where the aux
domain is a handful of single-bit crossings.

`gen_pcieep.py` now checks only that both clock lookups RESOLVE, which is what
decides whether the XDC `set_clock_groups` matched anything (an empty group is
a warning, not an error), and writes `report_clock_interaction` to a file for a
human. It is labelled in the script as the weaker check it is. **Consequence:
nothing currently proves the per-port CDC is being treated as asynchronous
rather than timed, and no per-clock WNS figure exists for this design.** If the
group did NOT apply, every WNS above is pessimistic rather than optimistic.

### OI-4: RESOLVED 2026-08-29 (`a2b20f3`) -- the descriptor-program generator exists

**CLOSED by TRACK BOARDAUDIT 2026-08-29.** `tools/gen_layer_program.py` is
1,155 lines, names backlog row 6 in its own header, and emits real bytes:
`d_table.hex` and a per-job `a<NN>_<tensor>.hex` for each of the 311 A jobs,
behind a full CLI. `tools/dprog_oracle.py` (956 lines) checks the EMITTED BYTES
against artefacts from other sources. Both VERIFIED present at HEAD.

Note the WORKLOG's own D-PROG section already said "**OI-4 is STALE at HEAD and
should be closed**" and the entry was left open anyway. A correction written in
one section does not close an issue recorded in another.

**Trap that survives the closure: `gen_layer_program.py` defaults to the
PRE-QKV-PAD packed set, where 48 of 311 A jobs are refused. Always pass
`--manifest`.**

Superseded text: Subsystem D's control core is integrated and mutation-tested,
but nothing emits the descriptor program it executes. This is **host software**
and it is on the critical path for both the card and the server. **UNBLOCKED
2026-08-28:** the descriptor format is settled and byte-pinned in
`docs/2026-08-28_matvec-descriptor-format.md`, whose section 7 carries a
reference builder in C for the A job. Still nothing emits it.

|---|---|---|
| **RY-ORACLE: subsystem C's output gets a value oracle, and it found a defect** | `R_Y` had NO integration-level model, which is why R7 was unkillable. Now modelled from the machine's own captured `R_QG`/`R_KIN`/`R_VIN`; coverage 58 -> 59 of 63. **R7 killed on the numbers.** B's three `R_Y` seams stay open for a STRUCTURAL reason (input includes recurrent state no region holds), not for want of effort. **Unplanned finding, defect C1:** `attn_block`'s `v_ref` fold has no layer dimension while its own comment says it must; live at the real shape's 8 attention layers; no bench could see it because `tb_attn_block` hardwires `layer => 0`. **Also WITHDREW the `R_ER` alarm as a stimulus artefact:** synthetic weights grow the residual 1.06e6x over four blocks against 1.10x real, and at the real shape there are ZERO annihilation cases. Warned that fixing C1 SILENTLY UN-KILLS R7. | `686fd97`, `08df58b`, `d6819e8`, `b32ecb5`, `0e867a0`, `eeb1200` |
| **BISECT: the first value oracle to reach integration level** | Built the capture path, then CORRECTED its own brief: the 9B reference cannot bisect a GHDL run (35,650x the arithmetic, ~15 days/token, and `v_n` at 13 bits cannot express `ffn = 12288`). Built a stepwise oracle instead: **58 of 63 seams clean in all three configurations**, N2 killed on the numbers at `R_XN-0` element 63. **Retracted its own gate verdict**: it read the FIRST of two report blocks in a log whose scratch tree had been deleted mid-run. Lesson: a grep returns every candidate verdict, only the LAST is the verdict. | `ecfd178`, `f6fda25`, `85f4e71` |
| **A-MUT: subsystem A's first mutation coverage, and the adversarial trace is the WEAKEST** | 57 mutations x 3 traces, ABORT as a third verdict. Committed gate 36 kills, ragged 40, **adversarial only 30** -- ten mutations the plain trace kills survive it, because identical products make rounding invisible (all at the rail) and adder-tree changes invisible by symmetry (`2*p == p+p`). **Saturation coverage and value diversity are OPPOSED.** Eight mutations are invisible to the committed gate (`tr.txt` has K=96 and M=8 exact, SATEV 0), including removal of the `sat32` clamp. Two stimulus gaps closed: `xmem` poisoned not zeroed, and an `err`-goes-HIGH assert (the guard on a `ybuf` overrun was itself unguarded). No RTL defect found. | `a3dc2f4` |
| **EMBDROP: 562 MiB per card, 2.195 GiB per cluster** | Repacked without `token_embd.weight` after Oren's decision. Recovered 589,287,424 B = tensor plus 17,080,320 B of stack-boundary hole no longer skipped; 6.86% of HBM, **29.5% of the N=4 spare**; `max_context_tokens` 52,319 -> 61,311. Made it a REVERSIBLE named flag, not a deletion. Checked the one thing that could falsify the premise: **`output.weight` is NOT tied** (different GGUF offsets, different bytes). Found `pl_open_opts`'s default bases point INSIDE the weight image in BOTH sets. Caught a stale line number in the dispatcher's own brief, off by 39. | `46216b3` |
| **TOKIO: the embedding was already decided, and the lm_head table was refused by its own gateware** | `seq_tbl_pkg` encoded a single 248,320-row lm_head job the descriptor plane REFUSES; now 15 windows at stride 17,376 (not 17,408: `17408 mod 48 = 32`). It now matches `gen_layer_program.py`'s DEFAULT output byte for byte, where before it matched only under `--one-lmhead-job`. **The embedding decision was NOT open** -- the host-writes-`R_X` path was already built (`seq_opdec`'s `tok_fsm` exists solely to publish it). New bench asks what four table-walking benches structurally cannot: they all take `TBL_STEPS` from the package. Scored one mutant killed by the LANGUAGE separately rather than claiming 11 of 11, and found a decoration check of its own. | `80d3a61` |
| **SPECREC: the six absent C units were six absent NAMES** | All thirteen spec-named responsibilities ARE implemented; the backlog verdict was an absent name read as an absent responsibility. `attn_score_q12.vhd` is real, is half of `attn_score_tree`, and is on NO spec list -- the mirror defect. Fourteen false claims corrected in place across five files, prioritised by blast radius. **27 read masters is 28**, so free HBM ports for B and C drop from 3 to 2. Nine analyses that never became work, four of them missing CHECKS -- and a missing check generates no artefact, so nothing reminds anyone. | `5b41635`, `f65e2bc`, part of `686fd97` |
| **CD-SEED: 60 gates in C and D, ZERO false-reds** | B's defect class is structurally impossible on C/D's bench side: all 25 benches are bit-exact, and C's bounds are DERIVED per case rather than fitted to a seed, so they move with the stimulus. B-SEED's 'widen it' rule does NOT transfer -- `attn_gate`'s oracle 1 attains its gate exactly at 20 of 40 seeds and widening would delete it. **One real defect fixed:** two committed vector files had no `tb_vector_args` row, so neither generator was ever built or run and five checks were unreachable. **Found that `mutate_attn_*.sh` score a DIED run as a KILL**, making C's published ratios unsafe. | `e27a9ad`, `9b02e8e` |
| **B-SEED: nine of thirty-five B thresholds fire on the HONEST unit** | Three at 98%, 82% and 58% of seeds. **The recursion is the finding:** B-RECUR's retune from that morning was ITSELF false-red -- its 52-seed sweep said honest max 15.429, thirty different seeds found 32.122, and two sweeps disagreeing 2.08x on a maximum means no feasible seed count bounds the tail. So COUNTS carry these benches, not maxima. Two thresholds had ZERO resolution left (a 2.5% window and a window of zero), recorded as never load-bearing again. Retunes took false-reds to 0 with all four kill ratios unchanged. Found a `SEED` knob that was inert: declared, printed, never passed. | `81297ee`, `0503be8`, `4a17dcc` |
| **TANDEM: available, and unevaluable until the design routes** | Confirmed by the TOOL, not the documentation: `create_ip xdma:4.1` accepts all four modes on this part. But the stage-1 pblock is a DRC-Error exclusion zone at `SLICE_X216Y0:SLICE_X232Y239`, **50,135 placed cells sit inside it**, and there is nothing to the right, so they all move LEFT into the congested half. Two things nobody had noticed: `DFX_over_PCIe` emits MCAP with NO stage-1 pblock, and **every non-GT pin is in bank 65, the config bank**, so observability must become static logic under any Tandem variant. Corrected the one-day ICAP estimate: right for the plumbing, wrong for the capability. | `abbd2ed` |
| **SHELL: the composed design does NOT route** | First FK33 build containing real arithmetic (subsystem A's descriptor plane as `fk33_engine`, 28 AXI masters). Places, then `[Route 35-3] Design is not routable as its global congestion level is 7` after six attempts over 7:47. **No bitstream exists.** NOT a timing miss (WNS -0.260) and NOT an area blowout (39.50% LUT, 55.03% DSP, 38.91% BRAM36). The engine SHRANK in the shell vs OOC (134,534 -> 132,113 LUT), so the OOC figures were honest. Corrected its brief three times: 192.5 vs 145.5 BRAM36 are different builds, masters are 28 not 27, and backlog 2's `llama_top` is a sim top with stories260K ROMs and no HBM interface. Found a combinational halt mask that did not block a GO, caught by a scratch bench with a firing negative control rather than by inspection. Peak RSS 22.81 GB. Filed OI-12 and OI-13. | `928ad9f`, `70c35db`, `d807a1c` |
| **LMHEAD: the whole token's A program is expressible** | `311 of 311 A jobs emitted, 0 refused` (was 296 of 297). 15 raw row windows at stride 17,376. **Route 2 refuted with the RTL as judge:** `matvec_int4_desc_axi`'s `S_CHECK` bounds `n_rows` in EVERY `out_mode`, so a 248,320-row descriptor is refused `err_code 0x3` in raw and BFP alike -- answering OUTMODE's open question NO. Raw over BFP is load-bearing: in BFP 832 of 1024 mantissas move and every value is exactly 2x, feeding a sampler whose only input is a bare 32-bit integer. 248,320 of 248,320 logits bit-identical, 9 of 10 mutations killed, m10 named a permanent structural non-biter. The 'destination region nobody has decided' does NOT exist: `dst = R_NONE` + `FLG_TO_SMP` was always there. Found a defect in `seq_tbl_pkg`, which encodes the job the gateware refuses. | `a781326` |
| **B-GATE: the flagship mutation now fails the gate** | `gdn_silu` and `rmsnorm_bf` had oracles that were PRINTED, not gated. Route B (in-bench real-valued oracle) chosen and Route A killed with one line: an RTL-only mutation leaves the generator reading the UNMUTATED 0.7704 LSB while the bench reads 1.68e10. Flagship closed WITH a control (same tree, only the bench swapped: FAIL new, PASS old). Gates max/count/mean/floor. **Warning for all of subsystem B: the committed `rmsnorm_bf` seed is the benign extreme of a 13x range** (honest worst 0.770 -> 9.999 LSB over nine seeds), so the pre-existing `ACC_LSB=1.0` fires on the HONEST unit at eight of nine seeds. Any B threshold calibrated on one seed is suspect. Also: a max-only gate could not have been made honest for either unit, and a mutation that destroys a unit reads BETTER than the correct one on every figure but the floor. 33 of 43 mutations killed, all 11 BOTH-class killed, 10 survivors named. | `728fcfe` |
| **QKV-PAD: 49 refused A jobs became 1** | Each fused row segment padded with ZERO rows to a whole `ROWS_IF` tile: starts 0/2064/4128, M = 8224 vs M_logical 8192, uniform across all 24 tensors and derived from GGUF metadata rather than the brief. Zero is the fill BECAUSE it is the only one also invisible under a WRONG scan domain (measured: a full-scale pad shifts ns 5 -> 8). 33,554,432 nibbles and 1,048,576 scales identical; 5 of 5 equivalence mutants bite. Found a silent pass in the tooling: a tile-aligned but WRONG `row_start` makes a descriptor the RTL accepts whose bases read past the tensor, and the gateware can never see it because `row_start` is not a descriptor field. | `e28083f` |
| **OUTMODE: raw mode had no oracle and wrote past the end of ybuf** | `out_mode=01` was already DRIVEN, by `tb_matvec_cb_lockstep` -- but that bench compares four runs against EACH OTHER and never against the reference. A round trip, not an oracle. With a real oracle attached, raw needed no new vector (`ref/matvec_int4.c` already emits `YDATA`; the loader dropped the line). Coverage 184/24 -> 464/343 values, masked rows now scored against zero rather than skipped. OI-10 fixed by narrowing the write ENABLE, not clamping the address as OI-8 did, with the reason in the code. **M6, the alternative fix form, DOES NOT BITE and is reported as a permanent floor:** nothing reads `ybuf` in raw mode, so no bench can separate the two forms. OI-11 WITHDRAWN for the arm it named (`f693faf` predates the filing, verified by ancestry) and closed on the AXU3EG arm it missed, where a `busy <= '0'` mutant passed all 22 cases. | `0ff6828`, `b65d9ad` |
| **B-FIX: three verification defects, and a corrected diagnosis** | Fixed D1 (golden two days behind its generator), D2 (the chain gate ran at the one `Z_DELAY` that hides the defect; bisection put the threshold at (520,540], corrected from '~512', and 640 is DERIVED from 616 cycles per head), and D3. **Corrected B-MUT's diagnosis on D3:** the sentinel-cancellation story explains only 14 of 17 cases past 100 LSB and the joint-worst case has NO saturation. The unifying statement is that the error is |a| times the softplus error, so the gate became a DOMAIN PREDICATE on inputs rather than a threshold. BOTH-class score 0 of 5 -> 4 of 5. Trap recorded: ghdl-mcode cannot override a `real` generic. | `ebcca86`, `6332abe`, `6e20668` |
| **TRACK TOP-KV: the KV seam at the INTEGRATION level** | `llama_top` instantiates `attn_kv_axi`, connects `attn_block`'s four seam handshakes, and advances a sequence position on `tok_done`/`tok_ack` instead of hardwiring 0. Four tokens of one sequence, TWO attention layers, three KV read latencies (100/7/403), R_X bit-identical per token, 0 KV faults. 26 mutation rows, 13 killed, 9 survivors all analysed. **Also closes backlog 14:** the gate had NO row with the real path on, and now has two. The 32-block real-weight landmark is byte-identical (`R_X(0) = -14110 hash 52347`, all 65 `log2 rms` samples). Regression 81 -> 83. `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_llama-top-kv-seam-multitoken.md` | see git log |
| Thermal guard synthetic trip | Guard halts, latches, freezes compute, releases. Teeth-checked. | `0b8831c` |
| Subsystem A at FK33 geometry | Bit-exact from real `.mv4i` bytes, 27 masters. Regression 76 -> 77. | `055b6ed` |
| AXI3 burst cap | HBM is AXI3, 16 beats not 128. Bit-exact at both; bench now runs the legal one. | `809ada7` |
| HBM port feasibility | 27 masters fit; 30 already measured at 288.0 GB/s, 100% of ceiling. Design note only. | doc only |
| Qwen3.5 tokenizer | Bit-exact vs llama.cpp, 53,411 strings x 2 + 1.1M codepoints. 7 of 9 mutations bite. | `4123bd8` |
| Qwen3.5 tokenizer in C | Bit-exact vs llama.cpp: 53,409 strings x 2, ALL 248,320 token ids, 1.1M codepoints, 20,051 malformed-byte strings. 7 of 7 mutations bite. +42,704 bytes linked, no new dependency. Found OI-5 and OI-6. | `0181cc3` |
| Full gate re-measured | 77 PASS / 0 FAIL, matches the recorded floor. Verified independently after `3246046`. | n/a |
| **C-ORACLE: `attn_block` did NOT compute attention** | First block-level oracle for subsystem C. 64 of 64 mantissas wrong on first comparison; bisected to TWO independent defects in `rtl/attn_block.vhd` (cached V exponents overwritten by the current token's, because `hdr_valid` is a level not a pulse; and every accumulator rescaled twice per rise, because `rs_have` re-latched from a still-standing `rs_valid`). Both fixed, oracle never adjusted. 17 wiring mutations, 17 killed. Regression 77, unchanged: a property was added to an existing test, not a test. VERIFIED SEPARATELY: `tb_attn_block` PASS and `tb_llama_top` PASS after the RTL fix. Note what that second one is and is not evidence for -- it shows the fix broke nothing, NOT that the fix is right, since `llama_top` runs one token at `cur_pos = 0` and never reaches either defect. The evidence the fix is right is the bit-exact oracle. | `8baa413` |
| A-sim MAXB correction | The original A agent woke, independently confirmed the AXI3 defect in its own bench, and appended a dated CORRECTION rather than editing the wrong claim out. Confirmation run completed separately: matvec_fk33, weight_streamer, axi_rd_port all PASS. | `2b12a7b` |
| **A-CTRL: the descriptor control plane, the CDC, and MAXOUT** (OI-1) | Descriptor format is D's, byte for byte, plus a four-word A extension AFTER the base array where D never reads. `matvec_int4_desc_axi` fetches and checks it before starting anything; `matvec_int4_axi` retained unchanged for the AXU3EG. Per-port async FIFO closes the HBM-to-core CDC; MAXOUT 2 -> 16. MEASURED: 100 of 100 elements bit-exact against `ref/matvec_int4.c` on the core bus AND 100 of 100 rows bit-exact through the AXI-Lite map, at `MAXB=16`, at four AXI/core clock ratios including a non-integer one. 22-case mutation table: 19 refused with the right code, 2 named as undetectable (see OI-1), 1 is the clean case. Found and fixed two of its own defects: a delta-skewed clock signal (broke `tb_matvec_int4_ip`) and a descriptor fetch left in the wrong clock domain (broke 17 of 22 cases under `DUAL_CLK`). Full gate 78 PASS / 0 FAIL, matches the raised floor. | `a4f7e17` |
| Magnitude blocker | Explosion was the STIMULUS (synthetic row norm 2^4.87 vs real 2^-0.03). PART 5 withdrawn, PART 3 reinstated. `attn_block` wired behind `C_REAL`. | `3246046` |
| **B-FIX: the three defects B-MUT measured in the CHECKING** | D1 `sim/gdn_conv_vec.txt` regenerated: 19 of 641 lines move, all case headers, all at `c % 7 == 0`, only the `cw_exp`/`e_seg`/`err` fields; no `x`/`w`/`sm`/oracle line moves and the worst-vs-oracle figure is unchanged at `4.99999999998181e-1`. Mutation R13 went pass -> FAIL against the committed golden. D2 `sim/regress.sh` now passes `-gZ_DELAY=640` to `tb_gdn_emit_chain`; MEASURED, the `z_have` mutation passes at 0/7/40/520 and fails at 540 and above, control PASSes at 640, so the kill threshold is (520, 540] and not the "~512" previously estimated. Cost 52 s -> 61 s. D3 the answer is NOT the expected one: the sentinel-cancellation diagnosis is INCOMPLETE -- the joint-worst case (70) has ZERO sentinel saturation and is 32767.9963 LSB wrong through the softplus negative-tail flush times an abs(a) of 3.09e14. `sim/tb_gdn_scalar.vhd` now GATES accuracy on a domain defined by a predicate on the INPUTS: 259 of 320 cases, worst 15.3271 LSB(Q15), gate 23.0, plus a count-past-1-LSB gate at 100 (67 measured) that catches B5 which the max cannot see, plus a beta gate and an in-domain-count FLOOR so the domain cannot empty. Teeth: 4 of 5 BOTH mutations now fail the BENCH; B4 deliberately still survives. `gdn_scalar` becomes the second of B's seven units with an accuracy gate `regress.sh` can fail. Full gate 81 PASS / 0 FAIL, matches the recorded floor; no test added or removed. Writeup: `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_b-verification-defects-d1-d3.md`. | `ebcca86`, `6332abe` + this |

## BACKLOG, ordered, ready-to-dispatch

**AUDITED END TO END 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT against `git rev-parse HEAD`
= `5a19f984`.** Every row below was judged by reading the tree and `git log`,
never by reading another document. Nine of the fourteen rows were already done;
four had never been struck by anyone and two of those cost a dispatch. The
genuinely open work is in the NEW rows at the bottom, and it is not what the
old table said it was.

**STRIKE A ROW IN THE SAME ACTION THAT LANDS IT.** This table had no such rule
and the In flight table did, which is exactly the difference in their accuracy.

### Closed rows, with what closes each

| # | task | closed by |
|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | `attn_block` <-> `attn_kv_axi` seam | `e7e7ae5`, with `sim/tb_attn_kv_seam.vhd`, `ref/attn_block_seq_vec.c`, `sim/mutate_attn_kv_seam.sh`. **Unstruck for a day; TRACK C-SEAM was dispatched onto it.** The dispatch was not wasted: it found OI-3b. |
| ~~2~~ | FK33 shell integration, then the congestion | Integration `928ad9f` / `70c35db`. Congestion RESOLVED by TRACK PBLOCK `ed1ffe2`: an **inherited SQRL constraint** at `hw/fk33/fk33_pcieep.xdc:138-145` assigned the whole block design to a pblock holding 67% of the assigned LUTs; it is `IS_SOFT`, so the placer crammed rather than failing, and `runme.log` said so in nine `Place 30-640` lines nobody read. Artefacts VERIFIED present: `hw/fk33/results/pblock_2026-08-29/ASX_route_status.rpt` (0 nets with routing errors, 288,506 fully routed) and `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_pcieep_eng.bit`, 22,568,402 bytes. **The bitstream has since been LOADED** (`docs/debugging/2026-08-29_first-engine-load-on-card.md`): configures, links Gen3 x4, identifies, BAR and DMA and HBM all round-trip. **What it COMPUTES is still unverified, and that is now row N1.** |
| ~~3~~ | `llama_top` instantiates `attn_kv_axi` and carries a sequence position | TRACK TOP-KV, see Landed |
| ~~4~~ | Token I/O: embedding and LM head | TRACK TOKIO `80d3a61` + TRACK EMBDROP `46216b3` |
| ~~5~~ | `pl_backend` v2 and the server seam | **LANDED, TRACK SERVER, `3963a60`, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_host-seam-v2.md`.** `server/pl_backend.{c,h}` is a full v2: `pl_prefill`/`pl_decode`, `fk33_transport` with chardev, filedir and sim backends, `fk33_manifest.c`. **This row was never struck. It is the SEVENTH such instance.** But read row N2 before believing the work is usable: `server/pl_backend.c`'s own first three lines say **"Nothing here has ever run against the card"**, and the register contract it drives is implemented by no RTL in this repository. |
| ~~6~~ | Subsystem D: the layer-level descriptor program | `tools/gen_layer_program.py`, 1,155 lines, `a2b20f3`, naming this row in its own header. Oracle `tools/dprog_oracle.py`, 956 lines. |
| ~~8~~ | `gdn_recur` / `gdn_exp_capture` mutation coverage + the `d_m` grid defect | **LANDED, TRACK B-RECUR, `ea26eec`, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_gdn-recur-coverage-and-dm.md`**, whose title is the answer: *the 8.955 LSB is not the d_m grid defect, and the gate that held it fires on the honest unit*. `sim/mutate_gdn_recur.sh` and `sim/mutate_gdn_exp_capture.sh` both exist. **Never struck. EIGHTH instance.** |
| ~~9~~ | Subsystem C spec reconciliation | **LANDED, TRACK SPECREC, `5b41635` / `f65e2bc`, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_spec-reconciliation.md`.** The row's own premise was refuted: all thirteen spec-named responsibilities ARE implemented; six absent NAMES were read as six absent units. **Never struck, and the board contradicted itself, because the Landed table has carried a SPECREC row the whole time. NINTH instance.** |
| ~~11~~ | The five B units with no accuracy gate `regress.sh` can fail | **LANDED.** `728fcfe` (`gdn_silu`, `rmsnorm_bf`), `81297ee`, `2868f6b` (the three emit units), then TRACK BGATE2 `f3cb87a` / `2c89814` / `589513c` / `1216a5e` / `dfe308c` pinned the goldens to the gate rather than to whatever lies in `sim/`. **`2868f6b` closed this TWELVE HOURS BEFORE BGATE2 was dispatched onto it**, which is the most expensive instance of the day and is written up in `2c89814`. Full unfiltered gate at `1216a5e`: `OVERALL PASS 99 FAIL 0`. |
| ~~12~~ | A whole-model 9B numeric reference | `91ba5ef`, `885420c`, `ecfd178`, `f6fda25`, `686fd97`, `0e867a0`; `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_9b-whole-model-reference.md`. The `llama_top` capture that was its remaining gap landed as TRACK CAPTURE, `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_capture-llama-top-r9bs.md`. |
| ~~13~~ | A composed synthesis at the real shape | **LANDED as two tracks, and the answer was NEGATIVE.** TRACK COMPOSE `01a9e95` measured B+C+D out of context at the real 9B shape: **DSP 591, and the model was right to 1.5%, so the DSP risk is retired**; LUT 771,900 against 268,222 free is **2.88x over**. TRACK REALFIX `3e93bed` retired the row's other half by making the real 9B shape elaborate in GHDL, so the first full-shape elaboration no longer happens inside Vivado on the critical path. **Residual is row N5**, a re-measurement after WRITEDEC. |
| ~~14~~ | Two real-path rows for the gate | TRACK TOP-KV: `sim/tb_llama_top_real.vhd` and `sim/tb_llama_top_seq.vhd` |

### Still open, ordered

| # | task | depends on | owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **N1** | **NOTHING HAS VERIFIED WHAT THE CARD COMPUTES, AND NO TOOL IN THIS REPOSITORY CAN.** This is the standing question and it now has a row. MEASURED: `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` puts the engine's own register map at **`ENG_CTL_BASE = 0x00012000`** and its activation writer at `ENG_XW_BASE = 0x00013000`; `grep -rn '0x12000\|0x00012000\|ENG_CTL' hw/fk33/host/ server/ tools/` returns **nothing**. `hw/fk33/host/fk33_regs.h` has no engine block at all, and `fk33ctl.py`'s commands are `sysmon thermal id scratch gpio vccint selftest bench load verify` -- none of which starts a job. So: write the host-side runner that builds one `matvec_int4_desc_axi` descriptor, points it at a real `.mv4i` weight already resident in HBM, starts it at `0x12000`, and compares the result against `ref/matvec_int4.c`. **The agent-safe half is all of it except the last step:** `server/fk33_transport.h` already offers `fk33_transport_open_sim` and `fk33_transport_open_filedir`, so the runner can be written and fully exercised with NO hardware. **The real run is Oren's, at the bench.** This is the first arithmetic on this silicon and every schedule below it is unfalsifiable until it happens. **Read open issue THERM-255 before trusting any result from it:** the thermal guard has been measured tripping roughly once every three minutes for reasons that are not heat, and each trip halts the compute domain, so a stall or a wrong answer with a non-zero trip count is not evidence about subsystem A. | none | `hw/fk33/host/` (new file), `hw/fk33/host/fk33_regs.h` |
| **N2** | **THE HOST SEAM CONTRACT HAS NO GATEWARE, AND NOBODY HAS SAID WHICH SIDE MOVES.** MEASURED: `server/fk33_seam.h` defines a register block with magic `0x4C4C4D32` ("LLM2") at `FK33_SEAM_BASE_PROPOSED = 0x0000E000`, and its own comment says **"BASE IS PROPOSED, NOT DECIDED"**. `grep -rln 'LLM2\|4C4C4D32\|SEAM_ID' rtl/ hw/fk33/rtl/ hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` returns **zero files**; `0xE000` is assigned nowhere in `gen_pcieep.py`. So the whole of row 5's work drives a contract no bitstream implements, which is why `pl_backend.c` line 2 says it has never run. **This is a DECISION, not a fix, and it is Oren's:** either (a) build an `fk33_seam` AXI-Lite block in front of subsystem D, which presumes D is on the card and it is not, or (b) retarget `pl_backend` at the descriptor plane that IS on the card, which makes the host own the step loop, or (c) leave the seam as the target contract and accept that row 5 is dead code until N3 lands. Do not let a track pick one. | N1 for evidence | decision |

### N2 RESOLVED 2026-08-30 by Oren: option (a). Build the seam in front of D.

Oren, verbatim: **"we don't want host controlling, let's get D working"**.

That selects **(a) build an `fk33_seam` AXI-Lite block in front of subsystem D**
and rejects (b) explicitly. (b) was "retarget `pl_backend` at the descriptor
plane that IS on the card, which makes the host own the step loop" -- and the
host owning the step loop is the thing being ruled out.

**The row's own objection to (a) stands and is now a work item rather than a
reason not to choose it:** (a) "presumes D is on the card and it is not". So (a)
depends on N3, the composed A+B+C+D place-and-route. That is the ordering, not
a blocker.

What this makes true:

- `server/fk33_seam.h`'s magic `0x4C4C4D32` ("LLM2") and
  `FK33_SEAM_BASE_PROPOSED = 0x0000E000` stop being proposed. The base still has
  to be **assigned in `gen_pcieep.py`**, where `0xE000` is currently assigned
  nowhere, and the register block still has to be **implemented in RTL**, where
  `grep -rln 'LLM2\|4C4C4D32\|SEAM_ID' rtl/ hw/fk33/rtl/ hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`
  returns zero files.
- Row 5's work stops being dead code, and `server/pl_backend.c` line 2 -- "Nothing
  here has ever run against the card" -- becomes a thing to fix rather than a
  thing to accept.
- The host-side step loop in `hw/fk33/host/fk33_run_token.py` becomes a
  **reference implementation and an oracle**, not the shipping path. It stays
  valuable exactly because it is bit-exact against `ref/run9b`: it is what the
  seam's output gets compared to.

**What it does NOT change, MEASURED, and this is the part that matters for
expectations.** Removing the host from the inner loop is worth the PCIe traffic
and nothing else. Fitting the card's own cycle counters across a 6x range of job
size:

```
CYCLES = 21.67 * BEATS + 215
  BEATS= 128 CYCLES=  2992  cycles/beat=23.38
  BEATS= 384 CYCLES=  8582  cycles/beat=22.35
  BEATS= 256 CYCLES=  5724  cycles/beat=22.36
  BEATS= 768 CYCLES= 16847  cycles/beat=21.94
```

The intercept is **215 cycles = 1.07 us**, so the per-job setup that D amortises
is worth **0.33 ms across a whole 311-job token**. The 21.67 cycles per beat is
**per-beat and does not amortise**, so **D does not touch it.** Anyone expecting
D to fix the engine's internal rate should read this first.
| **N3** | **NO RTL TOP COMPOSES A+B+C+D FOR THE CARD.** MEASURED: `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` instantiates `matvec_int4_desc_axi` and **nothing else** -- subsystem A alone. `rtl/llama_top.vhd` does instantiate all four (`matvec_int4`, `gdn_block`, `attn_block` + `attn_kv_axi`, the five `seq_*` + `rmsnorm_rs`, plus `sampler_stream`) but it is a SIMULATION top: it binds **`matvec_int4`, which has no descriptor plane**, and `C_REAL`, `C_KV_AXI`, `NORM_REAL` and `B_SRC_REAL` all default **false**. So between "B+C+D fits" and "9B runs on the card" there is an entire unwritten top level, and no row named it until now. **Blocked on WRITEDEC** (there is no point composing something that does not fit) and on N2 (the top level's host interface is exactly what N2 decides). | WRITEDEC, N2 | `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py`, `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_engine.vhd` (generated), a new synthesis top |
| **N4** | **BUILD-HANG's real fix, which nobody owns.** A shell build sat blocked on `wait_on_run synth_1` for **27.6 hours** for a run `launch_runs` reported as started and never created. The processes were killed 2026-08-29 with Oren's approval; **the defect is untouched.** Fix is two lines of discipline in `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`: a **bounded** wait, and a post-`launch_runs` assertion that the run directory actually exists. Small, self-contained, and the file is free. | none | `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` |
| **N5** | **Re-measure the composed B+C+D after WRITEDEC lands.** COMPOSE MEASURED 771,900 LUT against 268,222 free. LUTDIET MEASURED the fix on one unit (`rmsnorm_rs` 169,746 -> 40,804 LUT at identical ports, FF, WNS and zero BRAM) and PROJECTED B+C+D at 210,890 against 233,765 free in `pb_core` -- a **9.8% margin, which is positive and thin**. A projection is not a measurement and 9.8% is not enough margin to schedule against. Re-run `sim/ooc_compose_bcd.tcl` on the post-WRITEDEC tree. | WRITEDEC | `sim/ooc_compose_bcd.tcl`, `hw/fk33/results/` |
| **N6** | **OI-3's two named mutations have never been re-run against the gate that should now catch them.** TRACK OI3B (`5578132`) gave `tb_llama_top` a real value gate (`P14`, pinning `L_X0`). The two defects OI-3 names live at `rtl/llama_top.vhd`'s `c_exp_region <= to_unsigned(R_VIN, 8)` and `if k >= 2 then qg_buf(k-2) <= el_rdata`, both inside the config `tb_llama_top_real` exercises, and both move `R_X(0)`. So the gate *should* kill them -- but MEASURED by TRACK BOARDAUDIT, no mutate script and no line of OI3B's teeth table names either one, and OI3B's teeth were taken on different mutations (C1, the `v_ref` collapse, the `gdn_silu` truncation). **A gate that should catch a defect and has never been shown to is exactly the class this project keeps being bitten by.** Cheap: two mutations, one bench. | OI3B (landed) | `sim/mutate_llama_top_land.sh`, `sim/tb_llama_top*.vhd` |
| **N7** | **`EC_CORE` (0xE) is reachable by no bench in the tree**, and mutation `R1` deleting the `core_err -> EC_CORE` path survives both judges. Closing it needs a stimulus no bench currently produces. Raised by TRACK DESC-MUT with no owner; still none. | none | `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`, `sim/mutate_mv4i_desc*.sh` |
| **N8** | **Subsystem A coverage gaps, all three named by DESC-MUT and all three still open.** `rtl/matvec_int4.vhd` and `rtl/axi_rd_port.vhd` have **no mutation script**; `USE_XEXP_PORT=true` appears in **no bench at all**; and `DUAL_CLK=true` is a manual run, so the descriptor-path CDC -- whose absence once broke 17 of 22 cases -- has no automatic coverage. | none | `sim/mutate_matvec_int4.sh` (new), `sim/mutate_axi_rd_port.sh` (new), `sim/regress.sh` |
| **N9** | **The only surviving SQRL factory image has no off-disk copy.** `hw/fk33/bit/fk33_factory_backup_153300001366.{bin,mcs}` (33,554,432 B and 92,282,892 B) were dumped 2026-08-29 and VERIFIED by two independent reads with identical md5 (`dcb97432538b9c7d2855b1d9c93658f7`). They are **untracked in git** and sit only on a root filesystem at **91%**. Card 1's factory image was destroyed; this is its restore path and the only irreplaceable artefact in the project. Copy it to `/mnt/storage` (388 G free) and record the digest. Trivial, and the cost of not doing it is unbounded. | none | `hw/fk33/bit/` (copy only), a note in `docs/` |
| ~~**10**~~ | ~~OI-9 is a decision: widen, subdivide, or take a reserved D value. Ask Oren rather than choosing.~~ **DECIDED by Oren 2026-08-29: SUBDIVIDE VIA `ERR_INFO`.** See the Decisions table. The row is no longer a decision; it is row N12. | -- | -- |
| **N12** | **OI-9 implementation: subdivide the descriptor error space via `ERR_INFO`.** Oren decided the route on 2026-08-29, so this is determined work. VERIFIED still needed at HEAD: `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd` accounts for all sixteen 4-bit values (`EC_NONE 0x0`, `EC_DESC 0x3`, `EC_WDOG 0x4`, `EC_GEOM 0x9`..`EC_SHAPE 0xF`, with `0x1,0x2,0x5..0x8` reserved for D) and says so in its own comment. **The byte layout must not move** -- that is the reason the route was chosen. Two things this must carry, both already MEASURED by TRACK DESC-MUT: **`EC_DESC` (0x3) is raised at NINE sites with two confirmed collisions even with `ERR_INFO` pinned**, so "refused for the right reason" is currently recoverable for only 6 of 9 codes and subdividing `EC_DESC` is the first thing this buys; and `ERR_INFO` is a word index by construction, so the sub-case encoding has to coexist with that meaning rather than replace it. Update the host decoder in the same change or the card gains a code the host cannot name. | none | `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd`, `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd`, `server/pl_backend.c` (the decoder), `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`, `docs/2026-08-28_matvec-descriptor-format.md` |

| **N10** | **Gray coding still has no automated defence, and this is now precise.** TRACK CDC-STATIC's `sim/cdc_teeth.sh` and `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_cdc-static-analysis.md` (`be982b3`) closed two of the three classes: the encoder/decoder MISMATCH (`G2`) is caught by simulation, and the 2FF-vs-1FF MTBF class by `report_cdc`. **`G1`, both gray functions replaced by identity, is caught by neither** -- and is worse than uncaught, because the binary-pointer design reports TWO FEWER `report_cdc` warnings than the correct one, so any "the report must not get worse" rule passes it.

Any future change that deepens the codebook command path makes the invariant vacuous with nothing in the tree noticing. A standing hazard, not a task; recorded so it is not discovered by a defect. | none | `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` |

### THE ORDERED READY-TO-DISPATCH LIST

**STALE AS A WHOLE -- AUDIT BEFORE USING. Checked 2026-09-11:** this list was
produced 2026-08-29 and **row 1 (N1) has been ANSWERED since that same evening**
without ever being struck. The list reads as current and is not. Before
dispatching ANY row here, grep this file for a section that closes it -- for N1
that is "ROW N1 IS ANSWERED" -- because the closing sections are written and the
table is not updated. That asymmetry has now cost three dispatches by the board's
own count, plus one near-miss on 2026-09-11.


**Produced 2026-08-29 by TRACK BOARDAUDIT at HEAD `5a19f984`, after auditing
every row above against the tree.** READY means both of: its file ownership
does not collide with WRITEDEC, KVVALUE or CLOG2TOP, and its dependency has
landed. Ownership was checked against the rewritten table at the top of this
file, not against the stale one it replaced.

**Dispatch in this order. The first three are mutually non-colliding and can
run concurrently right now.**

| order | row | why now | owns | collides with a running track? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | ~~**N1**~~ | **ANSWERED 2026-08-29, STRUCK 2026-09-11.** Subsystem A computes correctly on the FK33: twelve jobs, all eight distinct `(M, K)` geometries, every mantissa and `y_exp` bit-identical to `ref/matvec_int4.c`, `err_code=EC_NONE` throughout, unconfounded by THERM-255 (counter read 0 before AND after every job). See `docs/debugging/2026-08-29_first-arithmetic-on-the-silicon.md` and the "ROW N1 IS ANSWERED" section above. **This row sat unstruck for 13 days and this dispatcher nearly dispatched onto it on 2026-09-11**, reading the list before the section that closes it -- the TENTH recorded instance of the board's own strike-on-landing rule not being followed. Original text: **The only item that converts "9B inference on the card" from unfalsifiable into measurable.** No dependency, no decision, no new RTL. **CORRECTED while this list was being written: `hw/fk33/host/` is NOT wholly free.** An undeclared track committed `4b26b7e` / `6d9c857` into `hw/fk33/host/fk33_load_weights.py` minutes ago. N1 adds a new file and edits `fk33_regs.h`, so it does not collide -- **but this is the second ownership error of the night and it was caught by watching `git log`, not by reading the table. Re-check `git log --oneline` for the target directory immediately before dispatching anything.** Write and fully exercise the runner through `fk33_transport_open_sim`/`_filedir` with **no hardware**; hand the final run to Oren, who is authorised for card 1 tonight and only tonight. | `hw/fk33/host/` (new file), `hw/fk33/host/fk33_regs.h` | no |
| **2** | **N12** | Oren decided the route hours ago, so it is determined work rather than a question. Carries DESC-MUT's `EC_DESC` nine-site collision measurement, which is the thing the route actually buys. | `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_pkg.vhd`, `rtl/matvec_int4_desc_axi.vhd`, `server/pl_backend.c`, `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`, `sim/regress.sh` (shared) | no |
| **3** | **N4** | Small, self-contained, and it is the fix for a defect that already cost 27.6 hours of a build slot silently. `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` was released by PBLOCK and nobody has claimed it. Fold **N9** into this track: copying the only surviving SQRL factory image off a 91%-full root disk is minutes of work and the cost of not doing it is unbounded. | `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py`; plus `hw/fk33/bit/` (copy only) for N9 | no |
| **4** | **N8** | Three named subsystem-A coverage gaps, all still open, all independent of everything running. Sequence it AFTER N12 if N12 is running, because both touch `sim/regress.sh` and one of them touches `tb_matvec_fk33_desc`. | `sim/mutate_matvec_int4.sh` (new), `sim/mutate_axi_rd_port.sh` (new), `sim/regress.sh` (shared) | no, but serialise with N12 |
| **5** | **N7** | `EC_CORE` reachable by no bench. Genuinely open, no owner. **Serialise after N12**, which is in the same file, and there is a real argument for making them one track: N12 subdivides the error space and N7 makes one of its codes reachable. | `sim/tb_matvec_fk33_desc.vhd`, `sim/mutate_mv4i_desc*.sh` | serialise with N12 |
| **6** | **N10** | The one gray-coding class nothing defends, now narrowed to `G1` alone by CDC-STATIC. Honest risk: it may be unclosable, and the write-up already argues so. Dispatch it as a question, not as a task, and accept "measured, cannot be closed, here is why" as a good result. | `rtl/async_fifo.vhd`, `sim/cdc_teeth.sh` | no |
| BLOCKED | **N6** | Cheap and valuable, but **KVVALUE owns `sim/tb_llama_top.vhd`**. Dispatch the moment KVVALUE releases. Closing N6 also closes or reopens backlog row 7, so it gates that too. | `sim/mutate_llama_top_land.sh`, `sim/tb_llama_top*.vhd` | **yes, KVVALUE** |
| BLOCKED | **N5** | Depends on WRITEDEC. It replaces LUTDIET's 9.8% PROJECTED margin with a measurement, and 9.8% is not a margin anyone should schedule against. Dispatch the moment WRITEDEC lands. | `sim/ooc_compose_bcd.tcl`, `hw/fk33/results/` | **yes, WRITEDEC** |
| BLOCKED | **N3** | Depends on WRITEDEC (no point composing what does not fit) and on N2 (its host interface is what N2 decides). The single largest piece of unwritten work between here and 9B on the card. | `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_engine.py`, a new synthesis top | **yes, WRITEDEC; and N2** |
| **OREN** | **N2** | A decision, not a fix: is the seam or the descriptor plane the contract? Raise it; do not let a track choose. N1's result is the evidence that should inform it, which is another reason N1 goes first. | decision | n/a |

**If all four slots are somehow free: N1, N12, N4+N9, N8.**

**What this list does NOT contain, said explicitly.** No row here claims the
card computes anything correctly, because nothing has measured that. N1 is the
row that would, and until it returns a number, every downstream estimate on
this board -- the LUT margin, the token budget, the schedule -- is arithmetic
about a machine whose arithmetic has never been checked.

## 2026-09-07 -- the three-cell card block design builds

**`pcieep_build.sh --bd-only` passes with the card in it.** Exit 0, zero
`ERROR:` lines, zero address-overlap warnings, `validate_bd_design` and
`make_wrapper` both clean, in BOTH configurations (`FK33_CARD=1` and unset).
This is LEGALITY ONLY: nothing was synthesised, so area, fit and timing for the
three-cell design remain unknown.

The design is `eng` (subsystem A) + `card` (B, C, D) + `bcgrant`, joined by the
11-net A seam, the card's AXI-Lite master onto the engine's control slave
through a new 2:1 smartconnect, the 34-net host seam replacing the subsystem-D
tie-off, and B/C through the grant onto SAXI_30/31 via a clock converter each.

Six faults were fixed to get there, none of them reachable by simulation; the
order matters because each was invisible until the previous one was fixed. See
`docs/debugging/2026-09-07_wiring-the-card-into-the-block-design.md`.

**Two guard defects found on the way, both worth remembering:**

- `FK33_ENG portcheck bad=2 (must be 0)` **and the build passed.** The counter
  was printed and never branched on, so a dangling master, an undriven ACLK or
  an undriven `compute_halt` would all have been reported into a log and
  ignored. It now raises.
- The seam tie-off guard reads the generated script's TEXT. Deleting the
  tie-off at Tcl run time would have left its text in place and the guard would
  have kept passing even if the delete matched nothing. The tie-off is now not
  emitted at all when the card is on.

**The grant's pool went from 3 HBM ports to 2, because 2 is all there is.**
32 SAXI, minus 2 host, minus A's 28. It never needed 3: port 0 is driven only
on AR/R and port 2 only on AW/W/B, so C's write moved onto port 0's idle write
channels. See
`docs/debugging/2026-09-07_the-grant-pool-was-one-port-over-budget.md`.

Full gate PASS 137 FAIL 0 BUILD-ERROR 0, unchanged from baseline.

**Next:** OOC synthesis of `fk33_card` is running, to get the first area figure
for B+C+D together. The 3h30m `synth_design -rtl` attempt that preceded this
was NOT the same thing -- it set `dissolveMemorySizeLimit 200000`, which
expands inferred memories into individual bits, and the hypothesis under test
is that real synthesis is faster because it infers BRAM instead.

## 2026-09-08 -- the software path is complete and verified; the bitstream is not

**Re-verified end to end tonight, all green, nothing outstanding on the host
side.** The OpenAI-compatible server, the driver/transport, the tokenizer, the
chat template and the FK33 host seam are finished work:

```
SEAM_SELFTEST   PASS (84 checks, 0 failed)   12 groups incl. the real transport
SERVER_STORIES  PASS (0 failed)              11 checks, echo/stream invariants
SERVER_E2E      PASS (0 failed)              6 chat cases + usage + tool refusal
```

Live against a running server: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions` streaming
and non-streaming, `/v1/completions`, correct `usage` accounting on both arms.
`stories260k` produces coherent prose and is token-identical to the AXU3EG VHDL
engine at temperature 0.

**What is NOT inference, stated plainly because the server states it too.** The
`qwen3.5-9b-fk33` arm runs the real chat template, the real tokenizer (bit-exact
against llama.cpp) and the real prefill/decode-returning-logits protocol against
a **SIMULATED** card that does not execute a transformer. Its tokens are
gibberish by construction and the model description says so. The only card
backends are `sim` and `file`; there is deliberately no flag that opens
`/dev/xdma*`.

So the remaining gap to generated output on hardware is exactly two things, both
below the host software, and neither is a software task:

1. **A bitstream for the three-cell card.** The block design builds as of
   2026-09-07; area, fit and timing are still unknown.
2. **A whole-model 9B numeric reference**, without which a real card's output
   cannot be checked against anything.

**Measurement trap hit tonight, recorded because it nearly produced a wrong
"fix".** `--model qwen35` refused at startup with `pl_open: block layout
refused: out of range: SEQ_POS + N_STEP past the KV capacity, or a block past
the top of HBM`. Grepping the journal for error-shaped words returned that line
and fragments, and it reads like a KV-capacity bug. It is not: the server
prints, immediately after, a complete remedy naming `--manifest` and
`--desc-arena-bytes` and the exact figure (159,232 bytes for the 9B program's
311 descriptors at a 512-byte slot). **The guidance was there and the grep cut
it off.** The zero default is deliberate -- `llama_server.cpp:986` says a silent
default is what the refusal exists to prevent -- and must not be "fixed".
Read the whole refusal, not a grep of it.

**Card OOC synthesis: still running at 5h15m, 15.4 GB under a 16 GB cap**,
`memory.events high 0` (no throttling), swap flat at 4 GB throughout, one RSS
dip at ~4h49m that was a genuine phase change rather than reclaim. This is the
first attempt at B+C+D together. The 3h30m `synth_design -rtl` that preceded it
is not comparable: it set `dissolveMemorySizeLimit 200000`, expanding inferred
memories to individual bits, and reached 14.5 GB without finishing.

## 2026-09-08 -- the card build runs bounded, and wants more than 17 GiB

Seven launches took the `FK33_CARD=1` build from "OOM-killed in 2.5 minutes" to
"running real synthesis under a hard cap". Three method changes did it, all
committed and gated on `FK33_CARD`:

1. **`synth_checkpoint_mode None`** -- the block design synthesises inside the
   top run instead of spawning an out-of-context run per IP. One run instead of
   many, and a bounded process that fails on a diagnosable error rather than
   ten that take the machine.
2. **VHDL 2008 on the 48 card sources, VHDL-93 on the two wrapper tops.** The
   requirements are OPPOSITE and each is invisible until the other is fixed.
3. **`set_param general.maxThreads 2`** -- bounds the parallel workers Vivado
   forks INSIDE a run. 10 processes -> 4, 21.16 GB -> 14.21 GB.

**Result: synthesis runs, reaches the GT wizard IP, and pins the cgroup at the
17 GiB ceiling in sustained reclaim.** `oom_kill 0` throughout -- `MemoryMax`
throttles before it kills -- but `MemAvailable` fell to 5.3 GB and swap began
to creep, so it was stopped by hand. **The true peak is NOT known; all that is
established is that it wants more than 17 GiB.**

Three memory mechanisms, each behaving differently, all met tonight:
`MemoryHigh` reclaims and is INVISIBLE to systemd-oomd; systemd-oomd kills on
PSI regardless of either limit; `MemoryMax` reclaims first and only then kills
its own cgroup. **`ManagedOOMPreference=avoid` was tried and is WRONG** -- it
frees nothing and redirects the kill onto a bystander, which here is
`code-server`.

**Next, and it is Oren's call rather than a track's:**

- **More RAM.** 2 free DIMM slots, 128 GB max; the documented preference is
  2 x 32 GB replacing the current pair rather than filling all four (which
  drops below 6000 MT/s). This is the only option that certainly works.
- **Or trim the card for a FIRST bitstream.** Nothing requires the first
  working card to be the full 9B geometry. A smaller `C_KV_BLOCK`, fewer
  `A_ROWS_IF`, or B omitted would prove the three-cell wiring on real hardware,
  which is worth more than a full-size build that cannot be synthesised.

`docs/debugging/2026-09-08_the-card-build-and-two-wrong-fixes.md`

## PROCESS DEFECT, 2026-09-14: I MONITORED THE JOB I WAS WATCHING AND NOT THE JOBS I WAS RUNNING

`probe10` finished at **08:41 MDT** with the root cause in its log. I read it at
**12:30**, when Oren asked. **Three hours forty-nine minutes**, with the answer
on disk and BOTH Vivado lanes idle.

There was a monitor on `cardooc` the whole time, firing every 30 minutes. There
was none on `probe9`/`probe10`, which were the jobs actually doing the work. I
even built `chain10.sh` to chain probe10 onto probe9's completion -- so the
chaining was careful and the NOTIFICATION was absent. A chain tells the next job
when to start; it does not tell ME when the last one ended.

**The rule: every background job that produces a RESULT I am waiting on gets a
completion notification, not just a completion.** `systemd-run` + a `sleep` loop
is a scheduler, not a monitor. The check is: "if this finishes while I am
looking elsewhere, what wakes me?" If the answer is "nothing", it is not
monitored, however well it is chained.

This is the REFILL RULE failing in a new way. The rule was written about not
leaving agent slots empty; here the slots were empty because I did not know the
work had finished. **Idle-because-unnoticed is indistinguishable from
idle-because-unscheduled, and costs the same.**


## 2026-09-14: MY CLAMP TURNED A DETECTABLE FAULT INTO SILENT WRONG NUMBERS

Fixing `gb_real.bp`'s `zb` (the 60-hour elaboration wall), v1 of the change
stored z DM-wide with a lane/word cursor pair. It was written up as an
IDENTITY, with three arguments from the code: sequential writes, a read of
exactly one word, and all writes completing before any read.

**All three arguments were true and the change was still wrong.**
`tb_llama_top` went **PASS 8 -> FAIL 6**, `R_X(0)` off by 29, with
`schedule mismatches=0 KV faults=0 B-state AXI faults=0`. Structure intact,
numbers wrong -- this file's oldest recorded lesson, hit again by me.

**The defect: `S_ZRD` has TWO entry paths and I reset the cursors on one.**
The `not B_SRC_REAL` bypass entered with stale cursors. I had verified the
index algebra twice and never enumerated the state's predecessors.

**AND THE REASON IT WAS SILENT RATHER THAN LOUD WAS MY OWN GUARD.** I wrote

    if zword < VH-1 then zword := zword + 1; end if;

as defensive clamping. `zword` is declared `natural range 0 to VH-1`, so
**without the clamp the second sweep would have raised a range error in
simulation on the first overrun.** The clamp caught that fault and converted it
into every element landing in the last word -- wrong numbers, no diagnostic.
It cost a full bench cycle plus a differential run to find what the subtype
would have reported immediately.

**A bounds guard on a value whose subtype already bounds it is not defence, it
is suppression.** Where a range is already declared, let it fire. v2 keys the
reset off `k = 0` at the top of `S_ZRD` -- both paths set `k := 0` before
entering, so a future third path cannot miss it -- and increments without
clamping.

**What actually found it: a DIFFERENTIAL run.** Keeping the old array alongside
the new store and asserting equality at every read printed
`ZBDIFF h=0 j=0 k=0 zlane=0 zword=3 VH=4 DM=32` in under a minute. Re-deriving
the algebra a third time would not have; the cursor was wrong, not the algebra.
**When a rewrite claims to be an identity, run both and assert it, rather than
arguing it.**


## 2026-09-15: THE CARD'S A BINDING (`ga_desc`) HAS NO BEHAVIOURAL COVERAGE

Found while trying to extend `sim/tb_fk33_cardtop_ident.vhd` to cover the arm a
fix has to change.

`fk33_llama_top`'s A-facing ports are **defaulted inputs** -- `a_y_we : in
std_logic := '0'`, `a_bvalid := '0'`, `a_job_done := '0'`, `a_y_data := (others
=> '0')` -- because "a VHDL entity cannot have a conditional port clause". The
identity bench **never connects any of them**: `grep -c` for `a_awaddr|a_y_we|
a_job_done|a_x_we` over the whole bench returns **0**, and its port map ends at
`bst_bresp`.

So with `A_DESC => true`:

- `a_bvalid` is stuck low, so `a_desc_adapter` never completes a descriptor
  write and `ad_done` never asserts;
- `a_y_we` is stuck low, so no y beat ever reaches `ga_desc.ap`;
- the FSM sits in S_GO/S_RUN and the run times out.

**The `A_DESC` generic is present on the bench and cannot be exercised.** The
bench's own header states the rule that both arms "must compute the SAME
numbers" and that the true arm "drives the REAL `matvec_int4_desc_axi`" -- that
is the INTENT; the wiring for it does not exist.

**Consequences, stated plainly:**

1. `ga_desc` -- the branch the CARD BUILDS -- has never been simulated. Its
   `ap` process, its y buffer, its handshake with `a_desc_adapter` and
   `a_job_counter`, and the S_GO ordering rule its own header calls "THE ONE
   ORDERING RULE" are all unverified behaviourally.
2. Every landmark this project quotes for the card top was measured on the
   `ga_real` arm, i.e. on the binding the card does NOT use.
3. Any fix to `ga_desc` -- including the y-store rewrite the elaboration stall
   requires -- is unverifiable until this is closed. Structure and synthesis
   can be checked; VALUES cannot.

This is this repository's own recorded failure mode: a per-unit evidence class
that says nothing about the composition, and a generic whose default quietly
selects the arm that is NOT shipped. It is the same shape as the harness-default
traps already catalogued, one level up: not a wrong default VALUE, but a bench
that cannot run the non-default arm at all.

**What closing it needs:** a descriptor-plane engine model in the bench -- an
AXI-Lite slave that accepts the adapter's descriptor writes and responds, plus a
y-beat producer whose numbers match what `ga_real` computes, since the identity
claim is that both arms agree. That is bench engineering, not a generic flip.


## 2026-09-20 TRACK GENSTAMP: A GENERATED FILE NOW RECORDS THE INPUTS THAT MADE IT

CLAUDE.md says to check line 2 of any generated file before editing it, and that
rule is performable by reading the file in front of you. TRACK BUILDREPORT found
the shape it does not cover: `hw/fk33/build_fk33_pcieep.tcl`'s line 2 is present
and correct, and it says nothing about the NINE environment variables that decide
what the generator emits. The prescribed remedy -- regenerate and diff -- is the
action that destroys the evidence, silently, with a plausible-looking diff.

**MEASURED: two generators read the environment, seven committed generated files
depend on out-of-band input, and exactly ONE has ever recorded it.**

That one is the argument for the whole idea. `rtl/hbm_tg_ip.vhd` has always
carried `Regenerate with: python3 tools/gen_hbm_tg_ip.py 30` in its own header,
and that command reproduces the committed file **byte-for-byte**, while the
generator's default (`16`) deletes **1,025 of 1,028 lines**. Its sibling
`hw/fk33/build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` records nothing; recovering its `30 300` took
three attempts and produced one false positive on the way.

`tools/genstamp.py` emits a uniform `GENSTAMP` block: every out-of-band input,
its value (`(unset)` where a default was taken), and the command that reproduces
the file. **Deterministic by construction** -- no time, no user, no host, no
working directory, and the rows sorted -- because five gate rows regenerate a
file and compare it against the committed bytes, and a timestamp would turn all
five red on every machine. (`rtl/ooc_cattnadapt_top.vhd` is this tree's recorded
counter-example: its "Regenerate with" line embeds a `/tmp/claude-.../scratchpad`
path from the session that wrote it.)

Stamped and regenerated: `hw/fk33/rtl/fk33_card.vhd` and `fk33_bc_grant.vhd`
(env `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK`, `FK33_A_ROWS_IF`), `rtl/hbm_tg_ip.vhd` (argv `NPORT=30`),
`hw/fk33/build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` (argv `NPORT=30 FCLK_MHZ=300`).

MEASURED, after the change: three consecutive regenerations byte-identical by
`sha256sum` in every case; gate rows `sim:fk33card` PASS 1, `sim:c4stale` +
`sim:gdnstale` PASS 2, `sim:ipsync` PASS 1, `sim:runguard` PASS 1,
`sim:shapemirror` PASS 1, `--only cardtop` PASS 3 -- nine rows, zero failures at
`--jobs 1` -- and `check_kv_map: 40 rows, 0 refused`.

TEETH: at `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16` the stamp changes in two lines and the body in one
(`C_KV_BLOCK => 32` becomes `16`), and `--check` under the default environment
reports STALE rc=1. On `rtl/hbm_tg_ip.vhd` the default regeneration now names its
own cause in **line 12 of the diff** instead of hiding it in the prose of line 4
above 1,025 deleted ports.

**The trap this task created, and it fired.** The first version built ONE
reproduce command for both of `gen_fk33_card.py`'s outputs, from the process
environment. `fk33_bc_grant.vhd` does not depend on `FK33_*` and is stamped
`inputs: NONE` -- yet under `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16` it grew by exactly 19 bytes, the
width of the `FK33_C_KV_BLOCK=16 ` prefix. **A stamp that claims no dependence
while varying with the environment is worse than no stamp**, because it is a
false negative in the one place someone would look. The command is now DERIVED
from the same list the rows are printed from.

**NOT stamped, by ownership:** `hw/fk33/gen_pcieep.py` (TRACK BUILDREPORT owns it
tonight; the patch is in the debugging file) and `hw/fk33/rtl/compose4_top.vhd`
(TRACK GATERED; 13 argv switches, and `sim:c4stale` checks it against the
DEFAULTS only, so whether the committed file was made with `--wire --mem` is
still open).

**Reported, not fixed, each having an owner:** `hw/fk33/pcieep_build.sh:89` runs
`gen_pcieep.py` unconditionally before every build, so the committed
`build_fk33_pcieep.tcl` is never the file that builds and its only consumer is
the human the missing stamp misled; `fk33_card.vhd`'s banner names
`tools/gen_bd_wrapper.py`, the library, not `hw/fk33/gen_fk33_card.py`, the
driver, so following the banner cannot reproduce the file; and this commit's
`build_fk33_hbmbw.tcl` carries one hunk that is not the stamp, `3219cb0`'s
derived-`tgRoot` fix landing eight hours late.

Full record, including the two traps where an unwritten file compared equal to
itself and read as a perfect reproduction:

## 2026-09-21 TRACK CBRUN: THE FOUR CODEBOOK ARMS DREW, AND THE OOC SAYS THE PER-ROW CHANGE DOES NOT BREAK THE INFERENCE AT ALL

Four arms, `CBO_TARGET=matvec_core`, `CB_STYLE=distributed`, at the card's
geometry, all on the BC-250 under a cap read back out of the running cgroup. No
hardware. No Vivado on the workstation. `rtl/matvec_core.vhd` NOT edited in the
repo (TRACK CBREVERT owns it); every arm is a tree under
`/mnt/storage/fk33_builds/scratch/cbrun`.

**MEASURED: `cb` is distributed RAM in ALL FOUR arms, identical to the digit.**
`cb_ram=26112 cb_ff=0 RAM32M16=1573 RAMD32=22022 RAMS32=3146 MUXF8=0` in `old`,
`new`, `bcast` and `fan` alike, 3,072 mapping-report rows and 1,536 distinct
`cb_reg` indices in each. `26,112 = 1,536 x 17` decomposes exactly as
14 RAMD32 + 2 RAMS32 + 1 RAM32M16 per copy.

**That is CBRAM's own falsifier 2 and it fired: the mechanism is NOT confirmed.**
The write statement's form does not gate the inference at this level in either
direction. The main session reached the same verdict independently at
`matvec_int4_desc_axi` the same morning, so it is not an artefact of the target.

**`[Synth 8-5859]` is refuted as an instrument.** Anchored count **0** in all
four arms, in runs where the mapping report names 1,536 `RAM32M16` copies. An
absent `8-5859` is compatible with a fully successful inference, measured four
times. The claim that the recognizer DECLINED `cb` in build 11b is WITHDRAWN in a
dated CORRECTION; build 10's positive message stands as a message that was really
printed. `gdn_block` is not in `matvec_core`'s closure, so the positive control
that specification relied on does not exist at this target even in principle.

**Option R3a is struck: `fan` IS `new`.** Identical cells/nets/pins
(171,716 / 2,046,259 / 4,708,060) and `cbx_any=0` -- the combinational aliases do
not exist in the netlist. R3a can never differ from `new`, so it could not have
restored anything. Same shape as CBOOC's `CB_STYLE=regs` null: two arms that are
secretly one, printing a full result row.

**The netlist facts that DO stand** (opt stage, same tree, controls `lut_mem`
13,414 / DSP 1,584 / BRAM 21.5 / SRL 830 unmoved in all four):
`cbw_ff` 19,968 -> 624, exactly **-19,344 = 13 x (1536-48)**; total FF
73,463 -> 54,126 = **-19,337**, so 7 flops reappear elsewhere; LUT
78,183 -> 77,560 = **-623**; `bcast` +629 FF over `old` and max command-net
fanout **32**.

**REGISTERED PREDICTIONS THAT MISSED, under their own names:** CBOOC's LUT delta
0 measured **-623** here and **+1,456** at `desc_axi` (wrong in both, opposite
directions); CBOOC's max fanout `1,537 -> 49` measured `1,537 -> 129`; CBRAM's
`MUXF8 0 -> 12,288` measured `0 -> 0`; CBRAM's `8-5859 fires for old` measured
absent. HITS: the 13-net control held exactly, `cbw_ff` -19,344 exact, `bcast`
+624 FF to within 5.

**The outlier fanout net is NAMED.** Twelve of thirteen command bits are
top-level ports (`cb_addr[0..3]`, `cb_data[0..7]`) and fall to exactly
`CB_RANKS = 48` with `to_other=0`. The thirteenth is the VALID bit, and it is the
outlier because its net is SHARED: 48 of its 128 loads are `cbw_v` flops and
**80 are pins elsewhere in the core**. In `old` the same net had 1,536 loads and
`to_other=0`. That is why the number is context-dependent -- 108 loads at
`desc_axi`, 128 here, and never 48.

**The revert is still right, and now rests only on card-level evidence:** build
9's pre-change codebook routes at WNS +0.061 / TNS 0.000, and build 11b failed to
ROUTE with 38 of 40 named contending nets being `core/cb[][][]`. It was never
contingent on the `8-5859` story, which is the only reason it survives.

**NEW OPEN ITEM, and it is not small: the codebook change may be a bystander.**
Both OOC levels now say the RTL difference alone does not cause the mux tree.
What differs between the card context and OOC is unseparated: the
`-mode out_of_context` flag, the enclosing hierarchy, the card's synthesis
directive and flattening, and 92% LUT occupancy. **Do not put `bcast` or `fan` on
a card build on the strength of this run.**

**Traps hit, mine included.** My own message greps were UNANCHORED and the log
contains the tcl source line that raises those limits: `8-7186` read 24,577
against a true **24,576 = 1,536 x 16**, and `8-10226` read 1 against a true 0.
The cap readback I added to avoid ELABCLASS's trap had the same bug shape itself
-- systemd ate the `$cg` in `bash -c`, so it read `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.high`,
got "No such file", and exited 0; only a deliberate teeth test on a throwaway
scope found it, and the fix is to write the wrapper to a file. All four arms hit
the 8G cap, so every `memory.peak` here is the cap and none is a footprint.

Full record, predictions scored unadjusted, and the CORRECTION: the dated TRACK
CBRUN section of
`docs/debugging/2026-09-20_the-codebook-stopped-being-ram.md`. Captures and
drivers: `hw/fk33/results/cbrun_2026-09-21/`.

### CORRECTION to the TRACK CBRUN entry above, same day

`24fd4cc` landed while the four arms were drawing and MEASURES that **build 11b
ran at `FK33_CB_STYLE=regs`** (`Parameter CB_STYLE bound to` reads
`distributed x4 / distributed x4 / regs x4` for builds 9/10/11b), where
`matvec_core` forbids its own RAM inference and `cb_rank_of` is the identity.
**`0b34200` did nothing in build 11b.** Two claims in my entry are withdrawn:

- **"What differs between the card context and OOC" is not a context question at
  all.** My arms ran at `distributed`, the card at `regs`. I invoked this
  project's real "parts do not sum across synthesis contexts" finding to explain
  a plain configuration difference, and the citation is what made it feel
  grounded. WITHDRAWN.
- **Build 11b's route failure is NOT evidence about `0b34200`**, because that
  commit is inert at `regs`. Naming the object bounds WHERE, never WHY. So "the
  revert is still right" now rests on ONE fact, build 9 routing clean at
  `distributed`, and is materially weaker than I wrote. Build 12 is the control.

**What the arms are worth after the correction, and it bears on the build in
flight:** they are the first synthesis evidence of HEAD's codebook at
`CB_STYLE=distributed`, which IS build 12's configuration, and it infers as
1,536 `RAM32M16` with `MUXF8 = 0`, identical to the pre-change RTL.
**REGISTERED before build 12 lands: build 12 should not carry the 12,288 `MUXF8`
tree, and if it does, the cause is not `0b34200`.**

**Unplanned cross-check between the two runs:** `24fd4cc` decomposes the card
DCP's `xq_reg` as 518 `RAMD32` + 74 `RAMS32`; my OOC census gives
`RAMD32 = 22,022` and `RAMS32 = 3,146` in all four arms, and
`22,022 - 1,536 x 14 = 518`, `3,146 - 1,536 x 2 = 74`. Both residuals match to
the unit, on different boxes and different netlists.

**And `REF_NAME =~ RAM*` over-counts, which my own `cb_ram` column uses.** My
`cb_ram = 26,112` is `1,536 x 17`, macro plus its sixteen bels; the honest macro
count is **1,536**, from `RAM32M16 = 1,573` less `xq_reg`'s 37. Read that column
as "macro plus children", never as copies.
